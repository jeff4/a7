## Part II / Chapter 2 / Theory of Force 1 of 3

1. Dühring: 
	* 'In my system, the relation between general politics and the forms of economic law is determined in so definite a way and at the same time a way so *original* that it would not be superfluous, in order to facilitate study, to make special reference to this point. 
	* 'The formation of *political* relationships is *historically the fundamental thing*, and instances of economic dependence are only *effects* or special cases, and are consequently always *facts of a second order*. 
	* 'Some of the newer socialist systems take as their guiding principle the conspicuous semblance of a completely reverse relationship, in that they assume that political phenomena are subordinate to and, as it were, grow out of the economic conditions. 
	* 'It is true that these effects of the second order do exist as such, and are most clearly perceptible at the present time; but the primary must be sought in *direct political force* and not in any indirect economic power.'
1. This conception is also expressed in another passage in which Herr Dühring
	* 'starts from the principle that the political conditions are the decisive cause of the economic situation and that the reverse relationship represents only a reaction of a second order...
	* 'so long as the political grouping is not taken for its own sake, as the starting-point, but is treated merely as a *stomach-filling agency*, one must have a portion of reaction stowed away in one's mind, however radical a socialist and revolutionary one may seem to be.*
1. This is Herr Dühring's theory. 
1. In this and in many other passages it is simply set up, decreed, so to speak. 
1. Nowhere in the three fat tomes is there even the slightest attempt to prove it or to disprove the opposite point of view. 
1. And even if the arguments for it were as plentiful as blackberries, Herr Dühring would give us none of them. 
1. For the whole affair has been already proved through the famous original sin, when Robinson Crusoe made Friday his slave. 
1. That was an act of force, hence a political act. 
1. And inasmuch as this enslavement was the starting-point and the basic fact underlying all past history and inoculated it with the original sin of injustice, so much so that in the later periods it was only softened down and 'transformed into the more indirect forms of economic dependence'; and inasmuch as 'property founded on force', which has asserted itself right up to the present day, is likewise based on this original act of enslavement, it is clear that all economic phenomena must be explained by political causes, that is, by force. 
1. And anyone who is not satisfied with that is a reactionary in disguise. 
1. We must first point out that only one with as much self-esteem as Herr Dühring could regard this view as so very 'original', which it is not in the least. 
1. The idea that political acts, grand performances of state, are decisive in history is as old as written history itself, and is the main reason why so little material has been preserved for us in regard to the really progressive evolution of the peoples which has taken place quietly, in the background, behind these noisy scenes on the stage. 
1. This idea dominated all the conceptions of historians in the past, and the first blow against it was delivered only by the French bourgeois historians of the Restoration period; the only 'original' thing about it is that Herr Dühring once again knows nothing of all this. 
1. Furthermore: even if we assume for a moment that Herr Dühring is right in saying that all past history can be traced back to the enslavement of man by man, we are still very far from having got to the bottom of the matter. 
1. For the question then arises: how did Crusoe come to enslave Friday? 
1. Just for the fun of it? 
1. By no means. 
1. On the contrary, we see that Friday 'is compelled to render economic service as a slave or as a mere tool and is maintained also only as a tool'. 
1. Crusoe enslaved Friday only in order that Friday should work for Crusoe's benefit. 
1. And how can he derive any benefit for himself from Friday's labour? 
1. Only through Friday producing by his labour more of the necessaries of life than Crusoe has to give him to keep him fit to work. 
1. Crusoe, therefore, in violation of Herr Dühring's express orders, 'takes the political grouping' arising out of Friday’s enslavement 'not for its own sake, as the starting-point, but merely as a stomach-filling agency'; 
1. and now let him see to it that he gets along with his lord and master, Dühring The childish example specially selected by Herr Dühring in order to prove that force is 'historically the fundamental thing', therefore, proves that force is only the means, and that the aim, on the contrary, is economic advantage. 
1. And 'the more fundamental' the aim is than the means used to secure it, the more fundamental in history is the economic side of the relationship than the political side. 
1. The example therefore proves precisely the opposite of what it was supposed to prove. 
1. And as in the case of Crusoe and Friday, so in all cases of domination and subjection up to the present day. 
1. Subjugation has always been–to use Herr Dühring's elegant expression–a 'stomach-filling agency' (taking stomach-filling in a very wide sense), but never and nowhere a political grouping established 'for its own sake'. 
1. It takes a Herr Dühring to be able to imagine that state taxes are only 'effects of a second order', or that the present-day political grouping of the ruling bourgeoisie and the ruled proletariat has come into existence “for its own sake”, and not as a 'stomach-filling agency' for the ruling bourgeois, that is to say, for the sake of making profits and accumulating capital.
