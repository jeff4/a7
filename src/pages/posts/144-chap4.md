## Part III / Chapter 4 / Distribution

1. We have already seen that Dühringian economics comes down to the following proposition: the capitalist mode of production is quite good, and can remain in existence, but the capitalist mode of distribution is of evil, and must disappear. We now find that Herr Dühring's "socialitarian" system is nothing more than the carrying through of this principle in fantasy.  
1. In fact, it turned out that Herr Dühring has practically nothing to take exception to in the mode of production--as such--of capitalist society, that he wants to retain the old division of labour in all its essentials, and that he consequently has hardly a word to say in regard to production within his economic commune. 
1. Production is indeed a sphere in which robust facts are dealt with, and in which consequently "rational fantasy" should give but little scope to the soaring of its free soul, because the danger of making a disgraceful blunder is too great. 
1. It is quite otherwise with distribution--which in Herr Dühring's view has no connection whatever with production and is determined not by production but by a pure act of the will--distribution is the predestined field of his "social alchemising".  
1. To the equal obligation to produce corresponds the equal right to consume, exercised in an organised manner in the economic commune and in the trading commune embracing a large number of economic communes.  
1. "Labour" is here 'exchanged for other labour on the basis of equal valuation...Service and counterservice represent here real equality between quantities of labour'. 
1. And this "equalisation of human energies" applies 'whether the individuals have in fact done more or less, or perhaps even nothing at all'; for all performances, in so far as they involve time and energy, can be regarded as labour done--therefore even playing bowls or going for a walk.  
1. This exchange, however, does not take place between individuals as the community is the owner of all means of production and consequently also of all products; on the one hand it takes place between each economic commune and its individual members, and on the other between the various economic and trading communes themselves.  
1. 'The individual economic communes in particular will replace retail trade within their own areas by completely planned sales'. 
1. Wholesale trade will be organised on the same lines: 
	* *The system of the free economic society...consequently remains a vast exchange institution, whose operations are carried out on the basis provided by the precious metals.* 
	* *It is insight into the inevitable necessity of this fundamental quality which distinguishes our scheme from all those foggy notions which cling even to the most rational forms of current socialist ideas.*

For the purposes of this exchange, the economic commune, as the first appropriator of the social products, has to determine, “for each type of articles, a uniform price” {277}, based on the average production costs. 
“The significance which the so-called costs of production ... have for value and price today, will be provided” (in the socialitarian system) “...by the estimates of the quantity of labour to be employed. These estimates, by virtue of the principle of equal rights for each individual also in the economic sphere, can be traced back, in the last analysis, to consideration of the number of persons that participated in the labour; they will result in the relation of prices corresponding both to the natural conditions of production and to the social right of realisation. 
The output of the precious metals will continue, as now, to determine the value of money... It can be seen from this that in the changed constitution of society, one not only does not lose the determining factor and measure, in the first place of values, and, with value, of the exchange relations between products, but wins them good and proper for the first time” {326- 327}.
The famous “absolute value” {D. K. G. 499} is at last realised.
On the other hand, however, the commune must also put its individual members in a position to buy from it the articles produced, by paying to each, in compensation for his labour, a certain sum of money, daily, weekly or monthly, but necessarily the same for all. 
“From the socialitarian standpoint it is consequently a matter of indifference whether we say that wages disappear, or, that they must become the exclusive form of economic income” {D. C. 263}. Equal wages and equal prices, however, establish “quantitative, if not qualitative equality of consumption” {268}, and thereby the “universal principle of justice” {282} is realised in the economic sphere.
As to how the level of this wage of the future is to be determined, Herr Dühring tells us only that here too, as in all other cases, there will be an exchange of “equal labour for equal labour” {D. C. 257}. 
For six hours of labour, therefore, a sum of money will be paid which also embodies in itself six hours of labour.  Nevertheless, the “universal principle of justice” must not in any way be confounded with that crude levelling down which makes the bourgeois so indignantly oppose all communism, and especially the spontaneous communism of the workers. It is by no means so inexorable as it would like to appear.
