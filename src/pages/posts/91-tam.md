* After some thought let's focus more on physician group practices.
* From Definitive Healthcare, there are about 338k PGPs in the US as of January 2024. You can download the CSV from [this page](https://www.definitivehc.com/resources/healthcare-insights/number-physician-group-practices-by-state).
	* Most populous states are: California 31k, Florida 26k, Texas 25.6k, New York 21k.
	* Big drop to next grouping: PA 13.9k, Illinois with 13k. NJ, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina each have about 11k - 12k.
	* Washington 7k, Oregon 4.1k
* Hm. last week, ChatGPT claimed there were 18k PGPs in the US. But Definitive Healthcare says there are 338k. :\
* Tried query in phind.com and Bing Co-Pilot and they repeated the 338k number from Definitive HC. Bing also highlighted this $3000 report from [Fortune Business Intelligence](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/u-s-physician-groups-market-106510). From the summary: 
	* 'The U.S. physician groups market size was valued at $293.27 billion in 2023 & is anticipated to grow from $305.88 billion in 2024 to $444.79 billion by 2032; this is a CAGR of 4.8% in this period.'
* Note. from the Fortune BI summary, looks like from 2012-2022, the % of physicians who moved from working in practices with 10 or fewer doctors decreased from 61% to 52%. based on data from the AMA.
* Based on number of physicians in a practice, Fortune BI splits PGPs into: 
	* 2 to 10 doctors
	* 11 to 24 doctors 
	* 25 to 50
	* 50+

### California’s Physician Practice Landscape: A Rapidly Changing Market with Limited Data (2022 report)

* Began learning more about PGPs based on this [2022 PDF](https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CAPhysicianPracticeLandscapeRapidlyChanging.pdf) focused on California.
* p.4 - As of 2020, 14% of doctors were in solo practice, 42.6% were in single-specialty group, 26.2% in multispecialty group. 
	* 9.3% were hospital employees or contractors.
	* 2.9% in a faculty practice
	* 5% were in some other practice, including ambulatory care and urgent care facilities.
* p.4 As of 2020 breakdown by practice size:
	* 2-4 doctors: 33.6%
	* 5-10 doctors: 20%
	* 11-24 doctors: 11.5%

# 6/06
# Thursday with ChatGPT, part 1
## Prompt 1
What is the total number of nurses working in the United States as of 2023 or the best (or most recent data you have available)?


## Answer 1

As of 2023, the estimated total number of nurses working in the United States, including Registered Nurses (RNs), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), is approximately 4.5 million.

### Breakdown of the Nursing Workforce:

1. **Registered Nurses (RNs)**:
   - Approximately 3.1 million.

2. **Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs)/Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs)**:
   - Approximately 950,000.

3. **Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs)**, which includes Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs), Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs), and Nurse Midwives (CNMs):
   - Approximately 400,000.


* JH note: ~400k number corroborated with this 385k number from American Association of Nurse Practitioners [article from November 2023](https://www.aanp.org/news-feed/nurse-practitioner-profession-grows-to-385-000-strong)


### Sources:
- **American Nurses Association (ANA)** and **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** provide regular updates on the nursing workforce.
- The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) and other professional organizations also track the number of licensed nurses.

These numbers are estimates and can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific methodologies used to count and categorize nurses. The nursing workforce has been growing steadily due to increasing demand for healthcare services, the aging population, and expanded roles for nurses in healthcare delivery.

## Prompt 2
Can you tell me the similarities and differences between LPNs (Licensed Practical Nurses), LVNs (Licensed Vocational Nurses), and various APRNs like Nurse Practitioners (NPs)?

## Answer 2
Certainly! Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs) are all integral parts of the nursing workforce, but they have distinct roles, education requirements, and scopes of practice. Here are the key similarities and differences:

### Similarities:
1. **Patient Care**: All these nurses are involved in direct patient care, focusing on improving patient outcomes.
2. **Licensure**: All require licensure to practice, ensuring they meet standardized education and competency requirements.
3. **Collaboration**: They often work collaboratively with physicians, other nurses, and healthcare professionals.
4. **Patient Advocacy**: All serve as advocates for patients, ensuring they receive appropriate care and support.

### Differences:

#### Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) and Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs):
- **Education**: LPNs/LVNs typically complete a 1-year diploma or certificate program that includes classroom and clinical training.
- **Scope of Practice**: 
  - Provide basic nursing care under the supervision of RNs and physicians.
  - Duties often include monitoring vital signs, administering basic medications, assisting with personal hygiene, and providing wound care.
- **Licensure**: Must pass the NCLEX-PN (National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses).
- **Work Settings**: Commonly found in long-term care facilities, hospitals, outpatient clinics, and home healthcare settings.
- **LVN vs. LPN**: The roles are essentially identical; the difference in terminology is mainly regional (LVNs in California and Texas, LPNs in other states).

#### Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) - Focus on Nurse Practitioners (NPs):
- **Education**: 
  - APRNs must hold at least a Master’s degree in Nursing (MSN) or Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP).
  - Extensive clinical training in a specialty area (e.g., family practice, pediatrics, geriatrics).
- **Scope of Practice**: 
  - Advanced clinical roles with a broader and more autonomous scope compared to LPNs/LVNs.
  - Can diagnose and treat medical conditions, prescribe medications, and develop treatment plans.
  - Often specialize in specific patient populations (e.g., family NPs, pediatric NPs).
- **Licensure and Certification**: 
  - Must pass a national certification exam in their specialty area.
  - Licensed by state nursing boards, and practice authority varies by state (full, reduced, or restricted practice).
- **Work Settings**: Commonly found in primary care, hospitals, specialty clinics, and increasingly in telehealth settings.
- **Autonomy**: NPs often work independently or in collaboration with physicians, with some states granting full practice authority.

### Summary:
- **LPNs/LVNs**: Provide basic nursing care under supervision, with a focus on assisting patients with daily living activities and monitoring basic health conditions.
- **APRNs (NPs)**: Hold advanced degrees, have a broader scope of practice, can diagnose and treat illnesses, and often have prescriptive authority.

The differences in education, scope of practice, and autonomy highlight the distinct roles each type of nurse plays within the healthcare system, with LPNs/LVNs providing foundational care and APRNs, particularly NPs, taking on more complex and autonomous roles in patient care.

These estimates provide a general view of how MDs and DOs are distributed across different healthcare segments, reflecting their diverse roles and the evolving healthcare landscape.

* **JH note:** This is not good. this answer indicates that 25% of MDs work in large hospitals. But the data I got the other day from ChatGPT indicates only 12% of MDs work at large hospitals. Additional queries with ChatGPT did not resolve this data issue.

## Prompt 7 - Claude from Anthropic

What percentage of doctors in the US work in large, academic hospitals, versus what percentage of doctors work in regional hospitals, versus work in private physician practice group versus work in all other categories?

## Answer 7 - claude answer

Unfortunately, I don't have definitive percentage breakdowns for where doctors in the US work across different practice settings. Physician employment data can vary based on the source and definitions used. However, here's an overview of some of the major practice settings for physicians in the US:

Academic Medical Centers/Teaching Hospitals:
Estimates suggest around 5-10% of physicians work in major academic medical centers associated with universities and teaching hospitals. These tend to be large hospitals in urban areas.

Regional/Community Hospitals:
A significant portion, likely 25-35%, work in non-academic community or regional hospitals across the country.

Private Practice:
Historically, private practices employed the majority of physicians, but this has been declining. Current estimates suggest around 30-35% of physicians now work in private practices owned by physicians or physician groups.

Hospital-Owned Practices:
An increasing percentage, perhaps 25-30%, are employed directly by hospitals or health systems in hospital-owned outpatient practices.

Other Settings:
The remaining physicians work in settings like outpatient clinics, federal facilities like VA hospitals, corporate practices, etc.

The percentages can vary across different specialties as well. But in general, while private practice was dominant in the past, more physicians are now employed by hospitals/health systems or working in larger group practices versus smaller private offices. Academic centers tend to employ a smaller but influential subset.

## Prompt 2

Excellent! Do you have any forward projections for the years 2025-2030? If possible, please use published research estimates. But if high quality research is not currently available, please feel free to provide a reasonable CAGR projection. In any case, please explain how you came about your numbers

## Answer 2

Forward projections for the number of clinical care providers in the United States can be estimated using historical data and applying a reasonable compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Given the trends in healthcare demand, workforce growth, and policy changes, we can project these numbers from 2025 to 2030.

Assumptions:
* Physicians: Historical CAGR of approximately 1% based on past trends and moderate growth expectations.
* Nurse Practitioners (NPs): Historical CAGR of around 5% due to increasing demand for primary care providers and expanding scope of practice.
* Physician Assistants (PAs): Historical CAGR of approximately 4.5%, reflecting growing utilization in various medical settings.
* Other Clinical Care Providers: Historical CAGR of around 2%, considering stable growth in nursing and allied health professions.

- **Physician Assistants (PAs)**: Estimated based on PA workforce trends in small hospital settings.
- **Other Clinical Care Providers**: Includes registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and allied health professionals, estimated based on historical data.

#### Projected Data (2025-2030):
- **CAGR Projections**:
  - **Physicians (MDs/DOs)**: Growth rate of ~1%, reflecting moderate growth trends.
  - **Nurse Practitioners (NPs)**: Higher growth rate of ~5%, due to increasing demand and expanded roles in community care.
  - **Physician Assistants (PAs)**: Growth rate of ~4.5%, based on past trends and expected demand.
  - **Other Clinical Care Providers**: Growth rate of ~2%, reflecting steady demand and expansion in roles.

These projections aim to provide a reasonable estimate based on historical trends, current workforce growth rates, and anticipated demand in Small Community Hospitals/Clinics. The numbers should be updated periodically with actual data and adjusted for any significant changes in healthcare policies, education, and market dynamics.

## Prompt 1

Assume you are a very experienced healthcare industry expert, for example a senior partner at McKinsey in their healthcare practice. I have heard varying estimates of how many prior authorization requests occur each year in the United States, ranging from below 100 million prior authorization requests per year to as much as 700 million prior authorization requests  per year. For the most recent data available, can you give me an estimate? Also, segment based on any logical grouping you may already be aware of.

## Answer 1

As an experienced healthcare industry expert, providing accurate and insightful analysis is of utmost importance. The issue of prior authorization requests is a significant one in the United States healthcare system, and the wide range of estimates you've mentioned highlights the complexity and lack of clear data in this area.

Unfortunately, there is no definitive comprehensive source for the total number of prior authorization requests across the entire healthcare system in the United States. However, based on various studies and industry reports, I can provide you with an informed estimate and segmentation.

According to a report by the American Medical Association (AMA) in 2019, physicians and their staff spent approximately 13 hours per week on prior authorization activities. Extrapolating this data, the AMA estimated that the total number of prior authorization requests in the United States could be as high as 182 million per year.

However, it's important to note that this estimate is focused primarily on physician practices and may not capture the full scope of prior authorization requests across the entire healthcare ecosystem, including hospitals, pharmacies, and other healthcare providers.

Another study by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in 2018 found that Medicare Advantage plans alone processed over 200 million prior authorization requests in a single year.

Taking these data points into account, along with the varying estimates you mentioned, a reasonable estimate for the total number of prior authorization requests across the entire U.S. healthcare system could be in the range of 300 million to 500 million per year.

In terms of segmentation, we can group prior authorization requests into the following categories:

1. Medical services (e.g., procedures, diagnostic tests, specialist referrals)
2. Prescription drugs (both outpatient and inpatient)
3. Durable medical equipment (DME)
4. Imaging services (e.g., MRI, CT scans)

Additionally, we can further segment these requests based on the type of healthcare provider or payer:

1. Physician practices
2. Hospitals
3. Pharmacies
4. Medicare Advantage plans
5. Commercial health insurance plans
6. Medicaid managed care plans

It's worth noting that the distribution of prior authorization requests across these segments may vary based on factors such as geographic location, patient population, and specific payer policies.

While the precise number of prior authorization requests may be difficult to pinpoint, it's clear that this administrative burden places a significant strain on healthcare providers, payers, and patients alike. Efforts to streamline and standardize the prior authorization process could potentially lead to significant cost savings and improved efficiency in the healthcare system.

## Prompt 2 for Claude

What percentage of prior authorization requests occur in the segment you identified above?


## Answer 2 from Claude

Unfortunately, there is no definitive data source that provides a comprehensive breakdown of the percentage distribution of prior authorization requests across the various segments I identified. However, based on the available industry studies and reports, I can provide an estimated distribution:

1. Medical services (e.g., procedures, diagnostic tests, specialist referrals):
   - This segment is likely to account for a significant portion of prior authorization requests, potentially around 40-50%.
   - Physician practices and hospitals are likely the primary drivers of requests in this category.

2. Prescription drugs (both outpatient and inpatient):
   - This segment could account for approximately 30-40% of prior authorization requests.
   - Requests in this category are likely to be distributed across physician practices, hospitals, and pharmacies.
   - Medicare Advantage plans and commercial health insurance plans are likely to be the primary payers involved in this segment.

3. Durable medical equipment (DME):
   - This segment is likely to account for a smaller portion, perhaps 5-10% of prior authorization requests.
   - Requests in this category are likely to originate from physician practices, hospitals, and specialized DME providers.

4. Imaging services (e.g., MRI, CT scans):
   - This segment could account for approximately 10-15% of prior authorization requests.
   - Requests in this category are likely to be driven by physician practices, hospitals, and diagnostic imaging centers.

It's important to note that these are rough estimates based on the available data, and the actual distribution may vary depending on the specific geographic region, healthcare system, and payer policies.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the distribution of prior authorization requests across segments may also differ based on the type of healthcare provider or payer involved. For example, Medicare Advantage plans may have a higher proportion of requests related to medical services and prescription drugs, while commercial health insurance plans may have a more balanced distribution across all segments.

Obtaining more comprehensive and standardized data on prior authorization requests remains a challenge in the healthcare industry, and efforts to improve data collection and reporting in this area could lead to more accurate and actionable insights.

## Prompt 3
How many people spend all or part of the time on their job on the provider side submitting and resubmitting prior authorization requests? I'm trying to get an estimate of the billing workforce in the United States involved in prior authorization submissions on the provider side. Please try to ignore clinicians who are involved in prior auth, especially peer-to-peer calls. I want to focus on prior auth specialists, billing staff, and other people who have no clinical responsibilities. However, if you believe a signficant amount of the manpower involved in prior authorization on the provider side *does* include people with clinical responsibilities, please provide a separate estimate of these clinical provider workers involved in prior authorization.

## Answer
Estimating the number of non-clinical staff involved in prior authorization (PA) submissions on the provider side involves considering the various roles dedicated to this task in different healthcare settings. These roles often include prior authorization specialists, billing and coding staff, and administrative support personnel. Additionally, some clinical providers do spend a significant amount of time on PA tasks, but I'll provide separate estimates for clinical and non-clinical roles as requested.

### 1. **Non-Clinical Staff Involved in Prior Authorization**

#### Large Hospitals (Academic Medical Centers and Major Health Systems)
- **Estimated Workforce**: 20,000-30,000
  - **Rationale**: Large hospitals typically have dedicated billing and prior authorization departments with numerous staff members handling high volumes of requests.

#### Regional Hospitals (Medium-sized hospitals serving large communities or regions)
- **Estimated Workforce**: 30,000-45,000
  - **Rationale**: These hospitals have substantial administrative staff, though fewer than large academic centers.

#### Small Community Hospitals / Clinics
- **Estimated Workforce**: 10,000-15,000
  - **Rationale**: Smaller facilities with fewer staff, often handling a lower volume of requests.

#### Private Physician Group Practices
- **Estimated Workforce**: 40,000-60,000
  - **Rationale**: Numerous practices, each with a small team dedicated to administrative tasks including PA.

#### Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) and Specialty Clinics
- **Estimated Workforce**: 8,000-12,000
  - **Rationale**: ASCs and specialty clinics typically have dedicated billing staff, but in smaller numbers.

#### Long-term Care Facilities and Nursing Homes
- **Estimated Workforce**: 5,000-8,000
  - **Rationale**: A moderate administrative workforce focused on authorizations for long-term care services.

#### Home Health Agencies and Hospice Care
- **Estimated Workforce**: 4,000-6,000
  - **Rationale**: Home health agencies often have dedicated billing staff, but the workforce size is generally smaller.

#### Retail Clinics and Telemedicine Providers
- **Estimated Workforce**: 1,000-2,000
  - **Rationale**: Fewer staff needed due to the nature of services provided.

#### Other Outpatient Care Centers
- **Estimated Workforce**: 6,000-9,000
  - **Rationale**: Outpatient centers vary in size but generally have dedicated billing staff.

#### Public Health and Government Hospitals
- **Estimated Workforce**: 3,000-5,000
  - **Rationale**: These facilities have smaller administrative teams compared to private hospitals.

#### Academic and Research Institutions
- **Estimated Workforce**: 4,000-6,000
  - **Rationale**: Moderate administrative staff focused on both research and clinical billing.

### Total Non-Clinical Workforce Involved in Prior Authorization
- **Estimated Total**: 131,000 - 198,000

### 2. **Clinical Providers Involved in Prior Authorization**

While the primary focus is on non-clinical staff, a significant number of clinical providers are involved in PA tasks, particularly in peer-to-peer reviews and clinical documentation support. Here's an estimate:

#### Clinical Providers (Physicians, Nurses, etc.)
- **Estimated Workforce**: 50,000-70,000
  - **Rationale**: Clinical providers often engage in PA, especially in complex cases requiring medical justification and peer-to-peer calls. This includes both part-time involvement and those with dedicated PA responsibilities within their clinical roles.

### Summary:
- **Non-Clinical Staff**: Approximately 131,000 to 198,000 individuals are involved in submitting and resubmitting PA requests.
- **Clinical Providers**: Approximately 50,000 to 70,000 clinical providers have significant involvement in PA processes.

These estimates provide a comprehensive overview of the workforce dedicated to prior authorization tasks on the provider side in the United States. The non-clinical staff primarily handle the bulk of administrative PA tasks, while clinical providers are involved in more complex, medically-focused aspects of the PA process.
