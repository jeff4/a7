## Prompt 1
Assume you are a highly informed and thoughtful industry expert on the medical provider market in the United States, encompassing doctors, nurses, nurse-practioners, and other caregivers. For example, you might be a very experienced and savvy senior partner at McKinsey's Healthcare practice. Can you give me a market segmentation of the number of hospitals, clinics, and physician group practices in the United States for the most recent year you have? Specifically, how may providers work in each of these segments: (1) Large Hospitals like Cleveland Clinic / Mayo Clinic, (2) Regional hospitals, (3) small community hospitals / clinics, (4) private physician group practices, (5) smaller places where medical providers might practice. Please add any additional segments that might make sense.

## Prompt 2
Using the same segmentation as above, roughly how many prior authorization requests are made from each segment each year in the United States? How many are denied on first submission per segment?

## Answer
Prior authorization (PA) is a process used by health insurers to determine if they will cover a prescribed procedure, service, or medication. The volume of PA requests varies significantly across different segments of the healthcare market. Here's an estimated breakdown of PA requests and denials for each segment based on available data and industry averages:

### 1. **Large Hospitals (Academic Medical Centers and Major Health Systems)**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~10,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~1,500,000 (15%)

### 2. **Regional Hospitals (Medium-sized hospitals serving large communities or regions)**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~15,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~2,250,000 (15%)

### 3. **Small Community Hospitals / Clinics**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~5,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~750,000 (15%)

### 4. **Private Physician Group Practices**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~20,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~3,000,000 (15%)

### 5. **Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) and Specialty Clinics**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~4,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~600,000 (15%)

### 6. **Long-term Care Facilities and Nursing Homes**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~2,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~300,000 (15%)

### 7. **Home Health Agencies and Hospice Care**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~1,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~150,000 (15%)

### 8. **Retail Clinics and Telemedicine Providers**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~500,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~75,000 (15%)

### 9. **Other Outpatient Care Centers**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~3,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~450,000 (15%)

### 10. **Public Health and Government Hospitals**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~1,500,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~225,000 (15%)

### 11. **Academic and Research Institutions**
   - **Annual PA Requests**: ~2,000,000
   - **Denials on First Submission**: ~300,000 (15%)

### Summary:
The total number of PA requests across all segments is approximately 64,000,000 annually, with about 9,600,000 being denied on first submission. The denial rate of 15% is an industry average, though it can vary slightly based on specific practices, regions, and the types of services being requested.

This breakdown provides a rough estimate, recognizing that exact numbers can fluctuate based on a multitude of factors, including changes in healthcare policy, insurance provider requirements, and the evolving landscape of healthcare delivery.

## Prompt 3
How many people spend all or part of the time on their job on the provider side submitting and resubmitting prior authorization requests? I'm trying to get an estimate of the billing workforce in the United States involved in prior authorization submissions on the provider side. Please try to ignore clinicians who are involved in prior auth, especially peer-to-peer calls. I want to focus on prior auth specialists, billing staff, and other people who have no clinical responsibilities. However, if you believe a signficant amount of the manpower involved in prior authorization on the provider side *does* include people with clinical responsibilities, please provide a separate estimate of these clinical provider workers involved in prior authorization.

## Answer
Estimating the number of non-clinical staff involved in prior authorization (PA) submissions on the provider side involves considering the various roles dedicated to this task in different healthcare settings. These roles often include prior authorization specialists, billing and coding staff, and administrative support personnel. Additionally, some clinical providers do spend a significant amount of time on PA tasks, but I'll provide separate estimates for clinical and non-clinical roles as requested.

### 1. **Non-Clinical Staff Involved in Prior Authorization**

#### Large Hospitals (Academic Medical Centers and Major Health Systems)
- **Estimated Workforce**: 20,000-30,000
  - **Rationale**: Large hospitals typically have dedicated billing and prior authorization departments with numerous staff members handling high volumes of requests.

#### Regional Hospitals (Medium-sized hospitals serving large communities or regions)
- **Estimated Workforce**: 30,000-45,000
  - **Rationale**: These hospitals have substantial administrative staff, though fewer than large academic centers.

#### Small Community Hospitals / Clinics
- **Estimated Workforce**: 10,000-15,000
  - **Rationale**: Smaller facilities with fewer staff, often handling a lower volume of requests.

#### Private Physician Group Practices
- **Estimated Workforce**: 40,000-60,000
  - **Rationale**: Numerous practices, each with a small team dedicated to administrative tasks including PA.

#### Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) and Specialty Clinics
- **Estimated Workforce**: 8,000-12,000
  - **Rationale**: ASCs and specialty clinics typically have dedicated billing staff, but in smaller numbers.

#### Long-term Care Facilities and Nursing Homes
- **Estimated Workforce**: 5,000-8,000
  - **Rationale**: A moderate administrative workforce focused on authorizations for long-term care services.

#### Home Health Agencies and Hospice Care
- **Estimated Workforce**: 4,000-6,000
  - **Rationale**: Home health agencies often have dedicated billing staff, but the workforce size is generally smaller.

#### Retail Clinics and Telemedicine Providers
- **Estimated Workforce**: 1,000-2,000
  - **Rationale**: Fewer staff needed due to the nature of services provided.

#### Other Outpatient Care Centers
- **Estimated Workforce**: 6,000-9,000
  - **Rationale**: Outpatient centers vary in size but generally have dedicated billing staff.

#### Public Health and Government Hospitals
- **Estimated Workforce**: 3,000-5,000
  - **Rationale**: These facilities have smaller administrative teams compared to private hospitals.

#### Academic and Research Institutions
- **Estimated Workforce**: 4,000-6,000
  - **Rationale**: Moderate administrative staff focused on both research and clinical billing.

### Total Non-Clinical Workforce Involved in Prior Authorization
- **Estimated Total**: 131,000 - 198,000

### 2. **Clinical Providers Involved in Prior Authorization**

While the primary focus is on non-clinical staff, a significant number of clinical providers are involved in PA tasks, particularly in peer-to-peer reviews and clinical documentation support. Here's an estimate:

#### Clinical Providers (Physicians, Nurses, etc.)
- **Estimated Workforce**: 50,000-70,000
  - **Rationale**: Clinical providers often engage in PA, especially in complex cases requiring medical justification and peer-to-peer calls. This includes both part-time involvement and those with dedicated PA responsibilities within their clinical roles.

### Summary:
- **Non-Clinical Staff**: Approximately 131,000 to 198,000 individuals are involved in submitting and resubmitting PA requests.
- **Clinical Providers**: Approximately 50,000 to 70,000 clinical providers have significant involvement in PA processes.

These estimates provide a comprehensive overview of the workforce dedicated to prior authorization tasks on the provider side in the United States. The non-clinical staff primarily handle the bulk of administrative PA tasks, while clinical providers are involved in more complex, medically-focused aspects of the PA process.
