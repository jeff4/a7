## 1940s
* **1943** - McCulloh and Pitts publish Perceptron paper.
* **1946** - First [Macy Cybernetics Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#Cybernetics_Conferences) held in New York. They would continue through 1953.
* **1948**
	* Norbert Weiner publishes first edition of [*Cybernetics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine).
	* September: [Hixon Symposium](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fas/psych/glossary/hixon_symposium/) at Caltech in September, 1948.
* **1949** [Donald Hebb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O._Hebb) proposes Hebbian Learning in *The Organization of Behavior*.  
* **1956** - Dartmouth Conference with John McCarthy
* **1957** - [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt), alum of Bronx Science, Cornell undergrad, Cornell PhD, builds the mechanical [first implementation of the perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron#Mark_I_Perceptron_machine) at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, funded by US Office of Naval Research and the Rome Air Developmwent Center.
	* See also this history at the [Cornell website](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/09/professors-perceptron-paved-way-ai-60-years-too-soon)
* **1969** - MIT mathematicians Minsky and Papert's critique of Perceptron

### Notes
* Some of the above notes are taken from this [Hacker Noon article](https://hackernoon.com/an-introduction-to-liquid-neural-networks-nt5c33t7).
* **1944** - Perceptron (aka the *McCulloch-Pitts neuron*) with zero layers proposed as pure mathematical expression by [Warren S. McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch) and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts). Paper was "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943). 
	* Fascinating history of Walter Pitts as a 15-yr-old runaway who impressed Betrand Russell at the age of 12. Died tragically young in 1969 at the age f 46.
	* Norber Weiner was a weird dude and had a massive falling out with both McCulloch and Pitts and cut them all off.
	* Liquid ANN article references 2017 [MIT article](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414?ref=hackernoon.com#:~:text=Neural%20networks%20were%20first%20proposed,the%20first%20cognitive%20science%20department.) that has subtitle *Ballyhooed artificial-intelligence technique known as “deep learning” revives 70-year-old idea.* 
* [Macy Cybernetics Conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#Cybernetics_Conferences) ran from 1946 - 1953. Pasquinelli first references this at the very beginning of Chapter 7 while discussing the Gestalt School. The one Pasquinelli focuses on is 
* **1952** - McCulloch and Pitts did this work at University of Chicago during and after the war. They moved to MIT in 1952.
