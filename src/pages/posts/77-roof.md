## 9/12/2024 thoughts

1. Need an electrician. Brian recommends Suresh, who does all the work for his own house and his family members. 631-790-8614
1. Quote on actually getting Soffit and Fascia replaced
1. Quote on adding 6" gutters
1. Quote on HDZ vs. UHDZ by GAF
1. Can they do carpentry work? Or can they recommend to someone else? Need to have them coordinate with electrician
1. How much to get new skylights (price per skylight?)


### Draft of email to Brian

Hi Brian,

Here are the items we discussed on the phone:
1. What is the name of the electrician you recommended?
1. What is the cost of replacing the fascia and the soffits?
1. What is the cost of replacing each skylight and (4x) all skylights at once?
1. What is the cost of using 6” gutters instead of the 5” gutters you suggested in the previous estimate? 
1. Also, do you recommend using leaf guards for 6” gutters? How much would 6” with guards cost versus 6” without guards cost? 
1. Because we don’t want the electrical work and (potentially carpentry work to build a new stud to anchor the electrical meter) to hold up the roof work, would it be possible to do the rest of the roof first and then deal with the power cable after rest of the roof is finished? Would that make sense and what cost would that add to the project? We can discuss this more in person when we meet again.
