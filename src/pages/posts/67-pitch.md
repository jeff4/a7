* Video posted at NYT on 2024-03-14.

### Notes
* mp4 file, 8:37 long
* 0:00 - 0:14 about patient who goes blind b/c of PA delays. Doctor says "Call me to defend why you think this patient needs this." Is what the Payer tells the referring PCP, forcing them to justify referall to specalist.
* 0:19 - 0:25 Multiple sclerosis case
	* v-o: Without warning, the insurance company stops your medications
	* Doctor: No you cannot give this drug
	* v-o: So you become paralyzed 
* 0:26 - 0:47
	* v-o: Imagine your father has cancer. His doctor orders an MRI
	* Doctor: No you cannot order this imaging. Have you considered using this cheaper cancer drug?
	* v-o: Insurance company causes delay after delay 
	* Doctor: You don't need this surgery
	* v-o: He dies. [camera close-up on woman wiping away tears]
* 0:47
	* NYTimes Opinion Title Card
* 0:57
	* v-o: An absurd process has infiltrated American healthcare. It's called Prior Authorization. Here's how it works. Before a doctor provides a treatment, your insurance requires them to prove it's necessary. This is often a time-consuming process that can cause dangerous delays.
* 1:05 - 1:16
	* Doc: I'm sorry, your cancer could be cured but we need to wait for the insurance company to approve your chemotherapy.
* 1:18 - 1:42
	* Introduces Dr. Shikha Jain, Oncologist
	* v-o: She's barricaded by PA daily.  
	* Dr. Jain: This is a really big issue (1:22 - 1:25)
	* **And it impacts every single person in this country who has insurance**. 
	* v-o: PA was actually created to save you money. Decades ago, it was used sparingly [graphic shows timeline moving from late 1970s to 1980]. Only to make sure that expensive treatments, like long hospital stays were absolutely necessary.
	* v-o: But now...
* 1:46 - 2:10
	* Dr. Jain: ..it's devolved into a system where a lot of times things are really denied for no reason. Even everyday medications now require insurance approval.
	* Doc 2: It could be for medications to treat heartburn
	* Docs 3-4: It could be med...It could be test strips to test blood sugar
	* Dr. Jain: ...chemotherapy..
	* More docs: ...Prozac...
	* Doc: when i prescribe a medication, I'd say that 95% of the [NYT graphic of large 95% number] time, I need to obtain a prior authorization
* 2:11 - 2:32 
	* v-o: NYT Opinion interviewed more than 50 doctors and patients. Their experiences suggest that insurance companies often weaponize this mundane process in order to control doctors and inflate their profits.
	* Doc 2 or 3?: If they deny care or delay care, that's money the insurance company gets to keep
	* Doc 4: The way they profit is to deny care.
* 2:33 - 2:40
	* v-o: As PA has spread, delays in care have become normalized...and so have tragedies.
	* images of various organs, hearts, procedures, surgeries, etc.
* 2:41
	* v-o: One in three doctors say it's caused a serious medical issue or even the death of one of their patients.
* 2:48 - 2:58
	* Focuse on patient named Ocean who went blind
	* Ocean: It was like the insurance company telling me that my life didn't matter.
* 2:59 - 3:07
	* Focus on patient Michael Trotman, MS patient
	* v-o: Michael couldn't walk or stand for 4 months.
	* Michael: And it's like, I am scared of MS. But my fear as of right now is right now is actually the insurance company.
* 3:08 - 3:29
	* Focus on patient Vivian Gonzales
	* v-o: Vivian lost her father to cancer.
	* Vivian: I spent so much time on the phone, writing letters, faxing...[long pause]...I didn't get to spend that time with my father.
	* v-o: This is medical injustice disguised as paperwork. 
* 3:31
	* Photos of PA denials.
	* Screen goes to black with just white text: Your request was denied.
* 3:35
	* When you PA is denied, you have three options
1. **Pay out of pocket.** v-o: But healthcare is so ridiculously expensive, that that's not really realistic.
1. **Abandon Treatment.** v-o: You can give up. That's what happens up to 80% of the time. A *win* for your insurance company.
1. **Appeal.** v-o: Or your doctor can go to bat for you. (3:54) 
	* Pediatrician: When our PAs get denied, we have to do what's called a peer-to-peer
* Finished up to 3:59
