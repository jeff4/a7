## Introduction: AI as Division of Labour
### Quotes
1. Jeanette Wing (2008): "The power of our 'mental' tools is amplified by the power of our 'metal' tools."
1. Damerow and Lefevre (1981): "When using a material tool, more can always be learned than the knowledge invested in its invention."
1. Lorraine Daston (2017): "Rules became mechanical before they could actually be executed by machines."

### 01 Recomposing a dismembered god

1. In a myth of cosmogenesis of the Vedas, it is narrated that the supreme god Prajapati is shattered into pieces in the act of creating the universe. 
1. In the aftermath of creation, counter-intuitive to Western narratives of mastery and principles of non-contradiction, the creator's body is found unstrung, dismembered. 
1. This ancient myth is still re-enacted today, in India, in the Agnicayana ritual, in which Hindu devotees symbolically recompose the fragmented body of the god by building the fire altar Syenaciti (see fig.  1. 1.1). 
1. The Syenaciti altar is laid down by aligning a thousand bricks of precise shape and size according to an elaborate geometric plan that draws the profile of a falcon. 
1. Workers compose five layers of 200 bricks each while reciting dedicated mantra and following step-by-step instructions. 
1. Solving a riddle that is the key to the ritual, each layer must maintain the same area and shape but a different configuration. 
1. Finally, the falcon altar must face east, in prelude to a symbolic flight of the reconstructed god towards the rising sun -- a unique example of divine reincarnation by geometric means.  
1. Agnicayana is meticulously described in the appendices to the Vedas dedicated to geometry, the Shulba Sutras, which were composed around 800 BCE in India, yet recording a much-older oral tradition. 
1. They narrate that the *rishi* (vital spirits) created seven square-shaped *purusha* (cosmic beings) which together composed a single body, and it is from this simple configuration that the complex body of Prajapati evolved. 
1. The Shulba Sutras teach the construction of other altars of specific geometric forms to secure the auspices of gods. 
1. They suggest, for instance, that 'those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus'. 
1. Beyond religious symbolism, the Agnicayana ritual and the Shulba Sutras in general had, in fact, the function of transmitting useful techniques for the society of the time, such as how to plan a construction and to enlarge existing buildings while maintaining their original proportions. 
1. Agnicayana exemplifies the originary social materiality of mathematical knowledge but also the hierarchies of manual and mental labour typical of a caste system. 
1. In the construction of the altar, the workers are driven by rules which are traditionally possessed and transmitted only by a specific group of masters. 
1. Aside from geometric exercises, rituals such as Agnicayana taught a kind of procedural knowledge which is not just abstract but based on continuous 'mechanical' drill, pointing once again to the role of religion as a motivation for exactness and, at the same time, to spiritual exercises as a way of disciplining labour. 
1. Agnicayana is a unique artefact in the history of human civilisation: it is the most ancient documented ritual of humankind that is still practised today -- although, due to its complexity, it is performed only a few times in a century. 
1. Across all this time, it has transmitted and preserved sophisticated paradigms of knowledge, and because of its combinatorial mechanism, it can be defined as a primordial example of algorithmic culture. 
1. But how can one possibly interpret a ritual as ancient as Agnicayana as *algorithmic*? 
1. One of the most common definitions of algorithm in computer science is the following: a finite procedure of step- by-step instructions to turn an input into an output, independently of the data, and making the best use of the given resources. 
1. The recursive mantras which guide workers in the construction site of the fire altar may indeed resemble the rules of a computer program: independently of the context, the Agnicayana algorithm organises a precise distribution of bricks which results every time in the construction of the Syenaciti. 
1. Historians have found that Indian mathematics has been predominantly algorithmic since ancient times, meaning that the solution to a problem was proposed via a step-by-step procedure rather than a logical demonstration
1. Similarly, the Italian mathematician Paolo Zellini has argued that the Agnicayana ritual evidences a more sophisticated technique than simple obedience to a rigid rule, namely the heuristic technique of incremental approximation.
1. It is known that Vedic mathematics, before other civilisations, was familiar with infinitely large and infinitesimally small numbers: ancient sutras already multiplied the positional numerals of the Hindu system to large scales to signify the vast dimensions of the universe (a speculative exercise that would be impracticable with the additive systems of Sumerian, Greek, and Roman numerals, for instance). 
1. Vedic mathematics was also familiar with irrational numbers, such as the square root, which in many cases (such as âˆš2) can only be calculated by approximation. 
1. The mantras of the Shulba Sutras intone the most ancient (and pedantic) explications of computational procedures (like to the so- called Babylonian algorithm) to approximate square root results. 
1. Procedures of approximation may appear cumbersome, weak, and imprecise compared to the exactitude of our mathematical functions and geometric theorems, but their role within the history of mathematics and technology is more important than is commonly thought. 
1. In his history of the techniques of incremental growth (which include the ancient method of gnomon, among others), Zellini has argued that the ancient Hindu techniques of incremental approximation are equivalent to the modern algorithms of Leibniz and Newton's calculus, and even to the error-correction techniques that are found at the core of artificial neural networks and machine learning, which constitute the current paradigm of AI (see chapter 9). To some, it may appear an act of misappropriation to read ancient cultures through the paradigm of the latest technologies from Silicon Valley or to study the mathematical component of religious rituals in an age of rampant nationalism.
1. However, to claim that abstract techniques of knowledge and artificial metalanguages belong uniquely to the modern industrial West is not only historically inaccurate but an act of implicit epistemic colonialism towards the cultures of other places and other times. Thanks to the contribution of ethnomathematics, decolonial studies, and the history of science and technology, alternative forms of computation are now recognised and investigated outside the Global North hegemony and its regime of knowledge extractivism. 
1. Because of their role in computer programming, algorithms are usually perceived as the application of complex sets of rules in the abstract; on the contrary, I argue here that algorithms, even the complex ones of AI and machine learning, have their genesis in social and material activities. 
1. Algorithmic thinking and algorithmic practices, broadly understood as rule-based problem-solving, have been part of all cultures and civilisations.  
1. Along these lines of inquiry, this chapter sketches a provisional history of algorithms, broadly examining in turn (1) social algorithms, that is, procedures that were embodied in rituals and practices, often transmitted orally and not formalised into symbolic language; (2) formal algorithms, that is, mathematical procedures to help calculation and administrative operations as they are found, for instance, in Europe since the Middle Ages and before that in India; and (3) automated algorithms, that is, the implementation of formal algorithms in machines and electronic computers starting with the industrial age in the West.

### Archaeology of the algorithm

1. The idea of investigating 'algorithms before computers' first came, unsurprisingly, from the field of computer science. 
1. In the late 1960s, the US mathematician Donald Knuth authored the influential book The Art of Computer Programming and gave important contributions to excavating the deep time of mathematical techniques in essays such as 'Ancient Babylonian Algorithms'. 
1. In those years, Knuth's mission was to systematise the field of computer science and to make it into a respectable academic discipline. 
1. The evidence of ancient algorithms was mobilised to stress that computer science was not about obscure electronic apparatuses but part of a long tradition of cultural techniques of symbolic manipulation. 
1. In this case, however, the archaeology of the algorithm was pursued not to demonstrate universalistic principles of thinking or the emancipatory potential of learning across the history of civilisation, but for the specific interests of the new classes of computer programmers and manufacturers:
	* *One of the ways to help make computer science respectable is to show that it is deeply rooted in history, not just a short-lived phenomenon.* 
	* *Therefore it is natural to turn to the earliest surviving documents which deal with computation, and to study how people approached the subject nearly 4000 years ago.*
	* *Archeological expeditions in the Middle East have unearthed a large number of clay tablets which contain mathematical calculations, and we shall see that these tablets give many interesting clues about the life of early 'computer scientists'.*
