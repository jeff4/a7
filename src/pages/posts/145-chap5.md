## Part III / Chapter 5 / State, Family, Education

1. With the two last chapters we have about exhausted the economic content of Herr Dühring’s 'new socialitarian system'. 
1. The only point we might add is that his 'universal range of historical survey' does not in the least prevent him from safeguarding his own special interests, even apart from the moderate surplus consumption referred to above. 
1. As the old division of labour continues to exist in the socialitarian system, the economic commune will have to reckon not only with architects and porters, but also with professional writers, and the question will then arise how authors’ rights are to be dealt with. 
1. This question is one which occupies Herr Dühring’s attention more than any other. 
1. Everywhere, for example, in connection with Louis Blanc and Proudhon, the reader stumbles across the question of authors’ rights, until it is finally brought safely into the haven of 'sociality', after a circumstantial discussion occupying nine full pages of the Cursus, in the form of a mysterious 'remuneration of labour'--whether with or without moderate surplus consumption, is not stated. 
1. A chapter on the position of fleas in the natural system of society would have been just as appropriate and in any case far less tedious.  
1. The Philosophie gives detailed prescriptions for the organisation of the state of the future. 
1. Here Rousseau, although 'the sole important forerunner' of Herr Dühring, nevertheless did not lay the foundations deep enough; his more profound successor puts this right by completely watering down Rousseau and mixing in remnants of the Hegelian philosophy of right, also reduced to a watery mess. 
1. 'The sovereignty of the individual' forms the basis of the Dühringian state of the future; it is not to be suppressed by the rule of the majority, but to find its real culmination in it. 
1. How does this work? Very simply:  
	* *If one presupposes agreements between each individual and every other individual in all directions, and if the object of these agreements is mutual aid against unjust offences...*
	* *...then the power required for the maintenance of right is only strengthened, and right is not deduced from the more superior strength of the many against the individual or of the majority against the minority.*
1. Such is the ease with which the living force of the hocus-pocus of the philosophy of reality surmounts the most impassable obstacles; and if the reader thinks that after that he is no wiser than he was before, Herr Dühring replies that he really must not think it is such a simple matter, for "the slightest error in the conception of the role of the collective will would destroy the sovereignty of the individual, and this sovereignty is the only thing” (!) 
1. “conducive to the deduction of real rights".  
1. Herr Dühring treats his public as it deserves, when he makes game of it. 
1. He could have laid it on much thicker; the students of the philosophy of reality would not have noticed it anyhow.  
1. Now the sovereignty of the individual consists essentially in that 'the individual is subject to absolute compulsion by the state'; this compulsion, however, can only be justified in so far as it 'really serves natural justice'. 
1. With this end in view there will be 'legislative and judicial authority', which, however, 'must remain in the hands of the community'; and there will also be an alliance for defence, which will find expression in 'joint action in the army or in an executive section for the maintenance of internal security', that is to say, there will also be army, police, gendarmerie. 
1. Herr Dühring has many times already shown that he is a good Prussian; here he proves himself a peer of that model Prussian, who, as the late Minister von Rochow put it, 'carries his gendarme in his breast'. 
1. This gendarmerie of the future, however, will not be so dangerous as the police thugs 130 of the present day. 
1. Whatever the sovereign individual may suffer at their hands, he will always have one consolation: 'the right or wrong which, according to the circumstances, may then be dealt to him by free society can never be any worse than that which the state of nature would have brought with it'!  
1. And then, after Herr Dühring has once more tripped us up on those authors’ rights of his which are always getting in the way, he assures us that in his world of the future there will be, "of course, an absolutely free Bar available to all".  
1. 'The free society, as it is conceived today', gets steadily more and more mixed. 
1. Architects, porters, professional writers, gendarmes, and now also barristers! 
1. This 'world of sober and critical thought' and the various heavenly kingdoms of the different religions, in which the believer always finds in transfigured form the things which have sweetened his earthly existence, are as like as two peas. 
1. And Herr Dühring is a citizen of the state where 'everyone can be happy in his own way'. 
1. What more do we want? But it does not matter what we want. 
1. What matters is what Herr Dühring wants. 
1. And he differs from Frederick II in this, that in the Dühringian future state certainly not everyone will be able to be happy in his own way. 
1. The constitution of this future state provides: 
	* 'In the free society there can be no religious worship; for every member of it has got beyond the primitive childish superstition that there are beings, behind nature or above it, who can be influenced by sacrifices or prayers'. 
	* A 'socialitarian system, rightly conceived, has therefore ... to abolish all the paraphernalia of religious magic, and therewith all the essential elements of religious worship'.
1. Religion is being prohibited.
1. All religion, however, is nothing but the fantastic reflection in men’s minds of those external forces which control their daily life, a reflection in which the terrestrial forces assume the form of supernatural forces. 
1. In the beginnings of history it was the forces of nature which were first so reflected, and which in the course of further evolution underwent the most manifold and varied personifications among the various peoples. 
1. This early process has been traced back by comparative mythology, at least in the case of the Indo-European peoples, to its origin in the Indian Vedas, and in its further evolution it has been demonstrated in detail among the Indians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Germans and, so far as material is available, also among the Celts, Lithuanians and Slavs. 
1. But it is not long before, side by side with the forces of nature, social forces begin to be active--forces which confront man as equally alien and at first equally inexplicable, dominating him with the same apparent natural necessity as the forces of nature themselves. 
1. The fantastic figures, which at first only reflected the mysterious forces of nature, at this point acquire social attributes, become representatives of the forces of history. 
1. At a still further stage of evolution, all the natural and social attributes of the numerous gods are transferred to one almighty god, who is but a reflection of the abstract man. 
1. Such was the origin of monotheism, which was historically the last product of the vulgarised philosophy of the later Greeks and found its incarnation in the exclusively national god of the Jews, Jehovah. 
1. In this convenient, handy and universally adaptable form, religion can continue to exist as the immediate, that is, the sentimental form of men's relation to the alien, natural and social, forces which dominate them, so long as men remain under the control of these forces. 
1. However, we have seen repeatedly that in existing bourgeois society men are dominated by the economic conditions created by themselves, by the means of production which they themselves have produced, as if by an alien force. 
1. The actual basis of the religious reflective activity therefore continues to exist, and with it the religious reflection itself. 
1. And although bourgeois political economy has given a certain insight into the causal connection of this alien domination, this makes no essential difference. 
1. Bourgeois economics can neither prevent crises in general, nor protect the individual capitalists from losses, bad debts and bankruptcy, nor secure the individual workers against unemployment and destitution. 
1. It is still true that man proposes and God (that is, the alien domination of the capitalist mode of production) disposes. 
1. Mere knowledge, even if it went much further and deeper than that of bourgeois economic science, is not enough to bring social forces under the domination of society. 
1. What is above all necessary for this, is a social act. 
1. And when this act has been accomplished, when society, by taking possession of all means of production and using them on a planned basis, has freed itself and all its members from the bondage in which they are now held by these means of production which they themselves have produced but which confront them as an irresistible alien force, when therefore man no longer merely proposes, but also disposes--only then will the last alien force which is still reflected in religion vanish; and with it will also vanish the religious reflection itself, for the simple reason that then there will be nothing left to reflect.  
1. Herr Dühring, however, cannot wait until religion dies this, its natural, death. 
1. He proceeds in more deep-rooted fashion. 
1. He out-Bismarcks Bismarck; he decrees sharper May laws not merely against Catholicism, but against all religion whatsoever; he incites his gendarmes of the future against religion, and thereby helps it to martyrdom and a prolonged lease of life. 
1. Wherever we turn, we find specifically Prussian socialism.  
1. After Herr Dühring has thus happily destroyed religion, 'man, made to rely solely on himself and nature, and matured in the knowledge of his collective powers, can intrepidly enter on all the roads which the course of events and his own being open to him'. 
1. Let us now consider for a change what 'course of events' the man made to rely on himself can intrepidly enter on, led by Herr Dühring.  
1. The first course of events whereby man is made to rely on himself is: being born. 
1. Then, for the period of natural minority, he remains committed to the 'natural tutor of children', his mother. 
1. 'This period may last, as in ancient Roman law, until puberty, that is to say, until about the fourteenth year.' 
1. Only when badly brought up older boys do not pay proper respect to their mother’s authority will recourse be had to paternal assistance, and particularly to the public educational regulations to remedy this. 
1. At puberty the child becomes subject to 'the natural guardianship of his father', if there is such a one 'of real and uncontested paternity'; otherwise the community appoints a guardian. 
1. Just as Herr Dühring at an earlier point imagined that the capitalist mode of production could be replaced by the social without transforming production itself, so now he fancies that the modern bourgeois family can be torn from its whole economic foundations without changing its entire form. 
1. To him, this form is so immutable that he even makes ”ancient Roman law”, though in a somewhat ”ennobled” form, govern the family for all time; and he can conceive a family only as a ”bequeathing”, which means a possessing, unit. 
1. Here the utopians are far in advance of Herr Dühring. 
1. They considered that the socialisation of youth education and, with this, real freedom in the mutual relations between members of a family, would directly follow from the free association of men and the transformation of private domestic work into a public industry. 
1. Moreover, Marx has already shown (Capital, {Vol. I,} p. 515 etc.) that 'modern industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the socially organised process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes'.  
1. 'Every dreamer of social reforms,' says Herr Dühring, 'naturally has ready a pedagogy corresponding to his new social life'. 
1. If we are to judge by this thesis, Herr Dühring is 'a veritable monster' among the dreamers of social reforms. 
1. For the school of the future occupies his attention at the very least as much as the author’s rights, and this is really saying a great deal. 
1. He has his curricula for school and university all ready and complete, not only for the whole 'foreseeable future' but also for the transition period. 
1. But we will confine ourselves to what will be taught to the young people of both sexes in the final and ultimate socialitarian system.
