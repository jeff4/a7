## Part III / Chapter 3 / Production
1. After all that has been said above, the reader will not be surprised to learn that the exposition of the principal features of socialism given in the preceding part is not at all in accordance with Herr Dühring’s view. 
1. On the contrary. 
1. He must hurl it into the abyss where lie all the other rejected 'bastards of historical and logical fantasy', 'barren conceptions', 'confused and hazy notions', etc. 
1. To Herr Dühring, socialism in fact is not at all a necessary product of historical development and still less of the grossly material economic conditions of today, directed toward the filling of the stomach exclusively. 
1. He's got it all worked out much better. 
1. His socialism is a final and ultimate truth; 'it is *the natural system of society', whose roots are to be found in a 'universal principle of justice'. 
1. And if he cannot avoid taking notice of the existing situation, created by the sinful history of the past, in order to remedy it, this must be regarded rather as a misfortune for the pure principle of justice. 
1. Herr Dühring creates his socialism, like everything else, through the medium of his famous two men. 
1. Instead of these two puppets playing the part of master and servant, as they did in the past, they perform this once, for a change, the piece on the equality of rights – and the foundations of the Dühringian socialism have been laid.  
1. It therefore goes without saying that to Herr Dühring the periodical crises in industry have not at all the historical significance which we were compelled to attribute to them.
1. In Dühring's view, crises are only occasional deviations from "normality" and at most only serve to promote "the development of a more regulated order". 
1. The "common method" of explaining crises by over-production is in no wise adequate for his "more exact conception of things". 
1. Of course such an explanation "may be permissible for specific crises in particular areas". 
1. As, for example, "a swamping of the book market with works suddenly released for republication and suitable for mass sale". 
1. Herr Dühring can at any rate go to sleep with the gratifying feeling that his immortal works will never bring on any such world disaster.  
1. Dühring claims, however, that in great crises, it is not over-production, but rather "the lagging behind of popular consumption...artificially produced under-consumption...interference with the natural growth of the needs of the people" (!) "which ultimately make the gulf between supply and demand so critically wide" 
1. And he has even had the good fortune to find a disciple for this crisis theory of his.  
1. But unfortunately the under-consumption of the masses, the restriction of the consumption of the masses to what is necessary for their maintenance and reproduction, is not a new phenomenon. 
1. It has existed as long as there have been exploiting and exploited classes. 
1. Even in those periods of history when the situation of the masses was particularly favourable, as for example in England in the fifteenth century, they under-consumed. 
1. They were very far from having their own annual total product at their disposal to be consumed by them. 
1. Therefore, while under-consumption has been a constant feature in history for thousands of years, the general shrinkage of the market which breaks out in crises as the result of a surplus of production is a phenomenon only of the last fifty years; and so Herr Dühring's whole superficial vulgar economics is necessary in order to explain the new collision not by the new phenomenon of over-production but by the thousand- year-old phenomenon of under-consumption. 
1. It is like a mathematician attempting to explain the variation in the ratio between two quantities, one constant and one variable, not by the variation of the variable but by the fact that the constant quantity remains unchanged. 
1. The underconsumption of the masses is a necessary condition of all forms of society based on exploitation, consequently also of the capitalist form; but it is the capitalist form of production which first gives rise to crises. 
1. The under-consumption of the masses is therefore also a prerequisite condition of crises, and plays in them a role which has long been recognised. 
1. But it tells us just as little why crises exist today as why they did not exist before.  
1. Herr Dühring’s notions of the world market are altogether curious. 
1. We have seen how, like a typical German man of letters, he seeks to explain real industrial specific crises by means of imaginary crises on the Leipzig book market – the storm on the ocean by the storm in a teacup. 
1. He also imagines that present-day capitalist production must 'depend for its market mainly *on the circles of the possessing classes* themselves'...
1. which does not prevent him, only sixteen pages later, from presenting, in the generally accepted way, the iron and cotton industries as the modern industries of decisive importance--that is, precisely the two branches of production whose output is consumed only to an infinitesimally small degree within the circle of the possessing classes and is dependent more than any other on mass use. 
1. Wherever we turn in Herr Dühring’s works there is nothing but empty and contradictory chatter. 
1. But let us take an example from the cotton industry. 
1. In the relatively small town of Oldham alone--it is one of a dozen towns round Manchester with fifty to a hundred thousand inhabitants engaged in the cotton industry--in this town alone, in the four years 1872 to 1875, the number of spindles spinning only Number 32 yarn increased from two and a half to five million; so that in one medium-sized English town there are as many spindles spinning one single count as the cotton industry of all Germany, including Alsace, possesses. 
1. And the expansion in the other branches and areas of the cotton industry in England and Scotland has taken place in approximately the same proportion. 
1. In view of these facts, it requires a strong dose of deep-rooted effrontery to explain the present complete stagnation in the yarn and cloth markets by the under-consumption of the English masses and not by the over-production carried on by the English cotton-mill owners.  
1. But enough. 
1. One does not argue with people who are so ignorant of economics as to consider the Leipzig book market in the modern industrial sense. 
1. Let us therefore merely note that Herr Dühring has only one more piece of information for us on the subject of crises, that in crises we have nothing 'but the ordinary interplay of overstrain and relaxation'; that over-speculation 'is not only due to the planless multiplication of private enterprises', but that 'the rashness of individual entrepreneurs and the lack of private circumspection must also be reckoned among the causes which give rise to oversupply'..
1. And what, again, is the 'cause which gives rise' to the rashness and lack of private circumspection? 
1. Just precisely this very planlessness of capitalist production, which manifests itself in the planless multiplication of private enterprises. 
1. And to mistake the translation of an economic fact into moral reprobation as the discovery of a new cause is also a piece of extreme 'rashness'.  
1. With this we can leave the question of crises. 
1. In the preceding section we showed that they were necessarily engendered by the capitalist mode of production, and explained their significance as crises of this mode of production itself, as means of compelling the social revolution, and it is not necessary to say another word in reply to Herr Dühring's superficialities on this subject. 
1. Let us pass on to his positive creations, the 'natural system of society'. 
1. This system, built on a 'universal principle of justice' and therefore free from all consideration of troublesome material facts, consists of a federation of economic communes among which there is 'freedom of movement and obligatory acceptance of new members on the basis of fixed laws and administrative regulations'.
1. The economic commune itself is above all 'a comprehensive schematism of great import in human history' which is far superior to the 'erroneous half-measures', for example, of a certain Marx. It implies 'a community of persons linked together by their public right to dispose of a definite area of land and a group of productive establishments for use in common, jointly participating in the proceeds'. This public right is a 'right to the object...in the sense of a purely publicistic relation to nature and to the productive institutions'.
1. We leave it to the future jurists of the economic commune to cudgel their brains as to what this means; we give it up. 
1. The only thing we gather is that it is not at all the same as the "corporative ownership of workers' associations" which would not exclude mutual competition and even the exploitation of wage-labour. 
1. In this connection he drops the remark that the conception of a 'collective ownership', such as is found also in Marx, is 'to say the least unclear and open to question, as this conception of the future always gives the impression that it means nothing more than corporative ownership by groups of workers'.  
1. This is one more instance of Herr Dühring’s usual 'vile habits' of passing off a thing for what it is not, 'for whose vulgar nature'--to use his own words--'only the vulgar word snotty would be quite appropriate'; it is just as baseless a lie as Herr Dühring’s other invention that by collective ownership Marx means an 'ownership which is at once both individual and social'.
1. In any case this much seems clear: the publicistic right of an economic commune in its means of labour, is an exclusive right of property at least as against every other economic commune and also as against society and the state.  
1. But this right is not to entitle the commune 'to cut itself off...from the outside world, for among the various economic communes there is freedom of movement and obligatory acceptance of new members on the basis of fixed laws and administrative regulations...like...belonging to a political organisation at the present time, or participation in the economic affairs of the commune'. 
1. There will therefore be rich and poor economic communes, and the levelling out takes place through the population crowding into the rich communes and leaving the poor ones. 
1. So that although Herr Dühring wants to eliminate competition in products between the individual communes by means of national organisation of trade, he calmly allows competition among the producers to continue. 
1. Things are removed from the sphere of competition, but men remain subject to it.  
1. But we are still very far from clear on the question of 'publicistic right'. 
1. Two pages further on Herr Dühring explains to us: 'The trade commune "will at first cover the politico-social area whose inhabitants form a single legal entity and in this character have at their disposal the whole of the land, the dwellings and productive institutions'. 
1. So after all it is not the individual commune at whose disposal these things are, but the whole nation. 
1. "The public right", "right to the object", "publicistic relation to nature" and so forth is therefore not merely "in the least unclear and open to question": it is in direct contradiction with itself. 
1. It is in fact, at any rate in so far as each individual economic commune is likewise a legal entity, "an ownership which is at once both individual and social".
1. and this latter “nebulous hybrid”  is once again, therefore, only to be met with in Herr Dühring’s own works.  
1. In any case the economic commune has at its disposal instruments of labour for the purpose of production. 
1. How is this production carried on? 
1. Judging by all Herr Dühring has told us, precisely as in the past, except that the commune takes the place of the capitalists. 
1. The most we are told is that everyone will then be free to choose his occupation, and that there will be equal obligation to work.  
1. The basic form of all production hitherto has been the division of labour, on the one hand, within society as a whole, and on the other, within each separate productive establishment. 
1. How does the Dühring 'sociality' stand on this question?  
1. The first great division of labour in society is the separation of town and country.
1. 'This antagonism...
