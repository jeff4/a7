## Hayek and the Epistemology of Connectionism
### Quotes
1. William Gibson
1. Friedrich Hayek, *The Sensory Order After 25 years* (1977): Mind thus becomes to me a continuous stream of impulses, the significance of each and every contribution of which is determined by the place in the pattern of channels through which they flow within the pattern of all available channels -- with newly arriving afferent impulses, set up by external or internal stimuli, merely diverting this flow into whatever direction the whole flow is disposed to move ... I liked to compare this flow of 'representative' neural impulses, largely reflecting the structure of the world in which the central nervous system lives, to a stock of capital being nourished by inputs and giving a continuous stream of outputs -- only fortunately, the stock of this capital cannot be used up.

## Introducing the classifier
1. It was not a cybernetiian but a neoliberal economist who provided the most systematic treatise on connectionism, or, as it would later be known, the paradigm of ANN (artificial neural networks).
    * From footnote 3: Donald Hebb introduced the term 'connectionist' in his 1949 book *The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory*, New York: Wiley & Sons, 1949. 
    * Rosenblatt adopted the term in 1958 to define his theory of artificial neural networks: Frank Rosenblatt, 'The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in the Brain', *Psychological Review* 65, no. 6 (1958).
1. In his 1952 book *The Sensory Order*, Hayek propounded a connectionist theory of the mind already far more advanced than the theory of symbolic AI, whose birth is, redundantly, celebrated anno 1956 with the exalted Dartmouth workshop. 
1. In The Sensory Order, Hayek provided a synthesis of Gestalt principles and Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts's idea of neural networks to describe 'the nervous system as an instrument of classification'. 
1. He went so far to speculate about the possibility of a device fulfilling a similar function, describing (in the jargon of today's machine learning) a classifier algorithm. 
1. In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt defined the perceptron (the first operative artificial neural network for pattern recognition) as 'connectionist' and acknowledged that the work of 'Hebb and Hayek' was 'the most suggestive' for his own.
1. While Donald Hebb was a neuropsychologist famous for the theory of brain cell assemblies -- a doctrine of neuroplasticity that is encapsulated in the dictum 'Neurons that fire together, wire together' seen in chapter 6 -- Hayek was an economist who studied the selforganisation of the mind in a similar way but in order to support a political belief: namely, the spontaneous order of markets. 
1. The perception that Hayek invented connectionism, however, is a simplification that overlooks his debt to the neurology and cybernetics of the time. One might better say that Hayek stole pattern recognition and transformed it into a neoliberal principle of market regulation.
