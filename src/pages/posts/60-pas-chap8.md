## Hayek and the Epistemology of Connectionism
### Quotes
1. Friedrich Hayek, *The Sensory Order After 25 years* (1977): Mind thus becomes to me a continuous stream of impulses, the significance of each and every contribution of which is determined by the place in the pattern of channels through which they flow within the pattern of all available channels -- with newly arriving afferent impulses, set up by external or internal stimuli, merely diverting this flow into whatever direction the whole flow is disposed to move ... I liked to compare this flow of 'representative' neural impulses, largely reflecting the structure of the world in which the central nervous system lives, to a stock of capital being nourished by inputs and giving a continuous stream of outputs -- only fortunately, the stock of this capital cannot be used up.
1. William Gibson, *Pattern Recognition* (2003): Homo sapiens is about pattern recognition...Both a gift and a trap.

### Introducing the classifier
1. It was not a cybernetiian but a neoliberal economist who provided the most systematic treatise on connectionism, or, as it would later be known, the paradigm of ANN (artificial neural networks).
    * From footnote 3: Donald Hebb introduced the term 'connectionist' in his 1949 book *The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory*, New York: Wiley & Sons, 1949. 
    * Rosenblatt adopted the term in 1958 to define his theory of artificial neural networks: Frank Rosenblatt, 'The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in the Brain', *Psychological Review* 65, no. 6 (1958).
1. In his 1952 book *The Sensory Order*, Hayek propounded a connectionist theory of the mind already far more advanced than the theory of symbolic AI, whose birth is, redundantly, celebrated anno 1956 with the exalted Dartmouth workshop. 
1. In The Sensory Order, Hayek provided a synthesis of Gestalt principles and Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts's idea of neural networks to describe 'the nervous system as an instrument of classification'. 
1. He went so far to speculate about the possibility of a device fulfilling a similar function, describing (in the jargon of today's machine learning) a classifier algorithm. 
1. In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt defined the perceptron (the first operative artificial neural network for pattern recognition) as 'connectionist' and acknowledged that the work of 'Hebb and Hayek' was 'the most suggestive' for his own.
1. While Donald Hebb was a neuropsychologist famous for the theory of brain cell assemblies -- a doctrine of neuroplasticity that is encapsulated in the dictum 'Neurons that fire together, wire together' seen in chapter 6 -- Hayek was an economist who studied the selforganisation of the mind in a similar way but in order to support a political belief: namely, the spontaneous order of markets. 
1. The perception that Hayek invented connectionism, however, is a simplification that overlooks his debt to the neurology and cybernetics of the time. One might better say that Hayek stole pattern recognition and transformed it into a neoliberal principle of market regulation.
1. Hayek began work on his theory of the mind in 1920, when he was an assistant in the laboratory of neuropathologist Constantin Monakow in Zurich, and continued developing it across a long list of publications throughout his career. 
1. He provided an impressive synthesis of ideas, from neurophysiology, holistic neurology, Gestalt psychology, system theory, empirio-criticism, and cybernetics -- although he mobilised this armamentarium of cognitive science with the purpose of making neoliberal principles look natural and universal. 
1. A striking example of this is that Hayek described the decentralisation of knowledge across the market in the same way in which Constantin von Monakow and Kurt Goldstein's theories of neuroplasticity described the decentralisation of cognitive functions across the brain.  
1. As seen in chapter 6, between the 1940s and the 1960s, the theory of self-organisation in markets contributed to the theories of selforganisation in computing networks, and vice versa. It must be said, however, that Hayek's theory of the market's spontaneous order was part of an ideological coup d'Ã©tat. 
1. Indeed, nothing looked less spontaneous than a market order within the sphere of influence of a nuclear superpower.
1. As noted earlier, historians of science and technology usually stress the influence of US military funding on the development of cybernetics and artificial intelligence. However, another front of the Cold War has to be acknowledged to complete the picture: the formation of neoliberal doctrines in response to the socialist calculation debate (described below) and Keynesian policies. 
1. Just as much as the decentralised topology of the Arpanet military network (the precursor of the internet) was designed as a reaction to Soviet military threat, Hayek's connectionism was conceived, among other stimuli, as a response to socialist centralised planning and Keynesianism. 
1. Reading Hayek through this lens helps to illuminate the influence of economic rationality on the early paradigms of artificial intelligence and trace the circulation of those ideas through models of minds, markets, and machines in the post--World War II years, but also to register the influence of political and social forces in the making of such models. 
1. It was a competitive market network that gave form to Hayek's neural networks, which were elevated to techniques for price calculation because, as Hayek confessed in the epigraph to this chapter, they were implicitly envisioned as 'a stock of capital being nourished by inputs and giving a continuous stream of outputs'. In this sense, Hayek's theory of the mind was but a variant of *mercantile connectionism*.
1. This chapter aims to put Hayek's epistemological project 'on its feet', so to speak, showing how his connectionist theory of the mind was used to shore up a specific (ideological) view of the market. 
1. This will require a schematic reconstruction of Hayek's argument from his economic paradigm backwards to his theory of cognition. 
1. Hayek tried to forward the following lines of argumentation: 
	* (1) that the economic problem is about the limited knowledge of free individuals which establish the optimal price of commodities on the basis of incomplete information; 
	* (2) that knowledge is acquired through the act of classification, or pattern recognition -- that is, the universal faculty to make categories out of perceptions that appear different and incomplete; 
	* (3) that classification happens via the self- organisation of connections in the brain, or neural networks -- in other words, that knowledge is not made of propositions and representations but is performed by a topology of connections to take decisions (to classify something within a class or not); and 
	* (4) that the mind is a dynamic mental order of connections that is related but not identical to the external order -- under which logic, knowledge is not a rigid representation but an approximate model of the world constantly rearranging itself. 
1. Eventually, in Hayek's political intention, connectionism and neural networks provide a relativist paradigm for justifying the 'methodological individualism' of neoliberalism.

### The decentralized and tacit rationality of the market
1. In 1945, Hayek intervened in the famous socialist calculation debate with the essay 'The Use of Knowledge in Society'. 
1. Ludwig von Mises of the Austrian school of economics had initiated the debate, arguing that in the absence of commodity prices as a unit of account, rational economic calculations would be impossible under the centralised bureaucracy of socialist economies. 
1. On the other side of the debate, it happened that Marxist economists such as Oskar Lange were questioning the importance of units of calculation such as money and labour time in the formation of prices. 
1. Hayek agreed with his mentor Mises but framed the anti-socialist argument differently: the economic order was, he claimed, an issue of spontaneous knowledge rather than of mathematical exactitude. 
1. Hayek saw the pricing of commodities as a spontaneous order emerging from tacit knowledge -- that is, as 'a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality'. 
1. For this reason, neither centralised institutions nor technical apparatuses of calculation could grasp and embody such knowledge efficiently. Hayek's famous passage on the decentralised rationality of the market reads:
	* *The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess.* 
	* *The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate 'given' resources -- if 'given' is taken to mean given to a single mind which deliberately solves the problem set by these 'data'.* 
	* *It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know.* 
	* *Or, to put it briefly, it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality.*
1. Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah believe themselves to have found here 'the First Commandment of neoliberalism. 
1. Markets don't exist to allocate given physical resources, so much as they serve to integrate and disseminate something called knowledge.' 
1. Curiously, the idea that knowledge is distributed across a system and not possessed by any single component in its totality is not an original one from Hayek but is derived from the non-localisation theory of brain functions of Monakow, with whom, as mentioned above, Hayek worked as assistant in 1920. 
1. Monakow advanced the hypothesis that cognitive functions (including memory) are not delimited in one specific part but are distributed across the whole brain. 
1. He coined the term 'diaschisis' (from the Greek for 'shocked throughout') to describe how an injured brain can recover cognitive functions through neural reorganisation. 
1. Monakow's holistic model of the brain (what nowadays would be called a model of 'neuroplasticity') was further systematised by another author Hayek read and often quoted, the Gestalt neurologist Kurt Goldstein. 
1. Hayek's idea that the market is a place of distributed knowledge therefore did not proceed from the study of economic phenomena but was first extrapolated from holistic neurology and early theories of neuroplasticity. 
1. In The Sensory Order, Hayek also referred to neurophysiologist Karl Lashley's idea of the brain's equipotentiality, which bears similarities to Monakow and Goldstein's:
	* *Certain mental processes which are normally based on impulses proceeding in certain fibres may, after these fibres have been destroyed, be relearned by the use of some other fibres.* 
	* *Certain associations may be effectively brought about through several alternative bundles of connexions, so that, if any one of these paths is severed, the remaining ones will still be able to bring about the result.* 
	* *Such effects have been observed and described under the names of 'vicarious functioning' and 'equipotentiality'.*
1. As von Neumann, among others, has suggested, holistic neurology influenced not only Hayek's idea of distributed knowledge across the market but also the architecture of distributed memory in computing machines. 
1. In his 1961 book Neurodynamics, Rosenblatt also acknowledged Lashley's and von Neumann's remarks on the distributed architecture of the brain as one of the main inspirations for the perceptron neural network. 
1. Alongside the decentralisation of knowledge in his economic paradigm, Hayek performed another important operation of decentring: the mobilisation of tacit knowledge. 
1. Hayek took great inspiration from Gilbert Ryle's 1945 paper, 'Knowing How and Knowing That', which famously defended the status of know-how and skills against the alleged 'higher' forms of conscious and procedural knowledge. Hayek writes:
	* *The 'know how' consists in the capacity to act according to rules which we may be able to discover but which we need not be able to state in order to obey them...* 
	* *Rules which we cannot state thus do not govern only our actions. They also govern our perceptions, and particularly our perceptions of other people's actions.* 
	* *The child who speaks grammatically without knowing the rules of grammar not only understands all the shades of meaning expressed by others through following the rules of grammar, but may also be able to correct a grammatical mistake in the speech of others.* 
1. What we recognise as purposive conduct is conduct following a rule with which we are acquainted but which we need not explicitly know. 
1. Similarly, that an approach of another person is friendly or hostile, that he is playing a game or willing to sell us some commodity or intends to make love, we recognise without knowing what we recognise it from. 
1. The holistic neurology of the time shared a similar position. 
1. For Goldstein, for instance, the unconscious is the locus not of primordial instincts that drive the conscious mind, as was the case with its Freudian predecessor, but, rather, of abstract behaviours as important as the conscious ones. 
1. By this account, the unconscious is a space of rules in the making, of embryonic abstractions to be perfected. 
1. Thanks to these studies, Hayek was able to declare that unconscious behaviours also possess the power to make habits, norms, and abstractions. 
1. Along similar lines, Mirowski and Nik-Khah comment that 'for Hayek, it was rationality that was largely unconscious...Knowledge here was no longer like entropy or pixie dust; now it resembled a great submerged iceberg, nine-tenths of it invisible.' 
1. Although captivating, the analogy of submerged rationality is not an accurate picture of Hayek's position. 
1. Reversing the usual topology of the mind, Hayek suggested that tacit knowledge is not subconscious but rather 'supra-conscious' or 'metaconscious'. He stressed the existence of meta-conscious rules that are as abstract as conscious ones:
	* *While we are clearly often not aware of mental processes because they have not yet risen to the level of consciousness but proceed on what are (both physiologically and psychologically) lower levels, there is no reason why the conscious level should be the highest level, and many grounds which make it probable that, to be conscious, processes must be guided by a supra-conscious order which cannot be the object of its own representations.* 
	* *Mental events may thus be unconscious and uncommunicable because they proceed on too high a level as well as because they proceed on too low a level.*
1. What escapes Hayek's assessment is that this decentralised and unconscious rationality is to be found not only in markets but also in other forms of human organisation and cooperation. 
1. Marx, for example, recognised the division of labour in workshops and manufactories as a form of spontaneous and unconscious rationality.29 Capital, according to Marx, does not just exploit workers individually but does so through the social cooperation that is augmented by the division of labour and machinery. 
1. As we saw in chapter 4, Marx assigned the power of the division of labour to the figure of the collective worker (*Gesamtarbeiter*), which is distinct from the sum of individual tasks; similarly, Hayek saw the market as a spontaneous form of selforganisation that is more than the mere sum of its individual exchanges. 
1. The difference between the two is that Marx, following Charles Babbage's lead, was aware that the spontaneous rationality of labour could be captured by the factory system and technological innovation, while Hayek assumed that the capture of the rationality of the market by a technical or institutional apparatus would be impossible and, if ever possible, illiberal. 
1. Hayek could not forecast that at the turn of the coming century, digital networks and large data centres, employing the very artificial neural networks discussed by cyberneticians, would be able to trace and compute social behaviours and collective rationality in real time, inaugurating a highly effective regime of knowledge extractivism on a global scale.
