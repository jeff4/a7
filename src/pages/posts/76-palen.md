## Chapter 1 - The Imperialism of Economic Nationalism: Globalizing the American System p. 13
* p. 25 The growing popularity of the American System in the British settler colonies of Canada and Australia, coupled with the Long Depression (1873 - 1890s), gave succor to imperial protectionists in Britain itself.
* p. 25 British economic nationalists had feared speaking above a whisper in the 1860s - 70s owing to the hegemonic hold of the [free-trade] Manchester School (*aka* Cobdenism). 
	* However, protectionist rumblings became a tumult by the late 1880s.
* Unsurprisingly, a British variant of the GHB (German Historical School -- a german variant of Henry Clay and Friederich List's American System) arose in the 1880s named the **English Historical School** (EHS). p. 25
* A capitalist manufacturer and Conservative politician from Birmingham, England named Sampson Samuel Lloyd published the first British translation of Friederich List's *The National System of Political Economy* in 1885. p. 25
