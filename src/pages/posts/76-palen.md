## Introduction p. 1
* p. 1-2 about Gershwin brother's *Strike Up the Band* a satirical musical about cheese trade war between the US and Switzerland in 1927.

### Friederich List p. 14
* Friederich List first introduced on p. 14. Born and raised in German, [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_List) lived in Pennsylvania from 1825-1831 and moved to other parts of US before moving to Leipzig in 1833.
* During his stay in the USA, List left his indelible mark on the likes of American Henry Charles Carey (also protectionist / economic nationalist) and the future US Republican Party's protectionism.
* 1827, List publishes *Outlines of American Political Economy* which is inspired by the American System.
	* *Outlines* establishes List as an authority on US fiscal policy and *champion of US protectionism*. 

#### The National System of Political Economy p. 14, p. 18-22 
* In 1841, [List's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_List#Journalism_and_The_National_System:_1837â€“1841) publishes *The National System of Political Economy* while living back in future Germany. p. 18 
	* German title: *Das national System der politischen Oekonomie*
* List's ideas went far in shaping imperial globalization by at once:
	1. Attacking British free trade;
	1. Encouraging high import tariffs and domestic subsidies to foster national industrial development;
	1. Contending that Western industrializing powers such as the US, Belgium France, and Germany required colonial expansion to obtain: (a) national security, (b) raw materials, and (c) new export markets for surplus capital.
	1. Furthermore, these Western powers should colonize the undeveloped "uninstructed, indolent" nations in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. So that these colonies could focus on the production of raw materials for their industrializing colonial masters.
* After all, this combination of economic nationalism and colonialism was precisely what Britain had used to ascend to industrial preeminence in the decades prior to the post-1846 embrace of free trade (abolishment of protectionist Corn Laws).
	* It seems that now that Britan had achieved escape velocity for industrialization, it sought to "kick away the ladder" for competing Western imperialist countries.
* British free traders and their compatriots in other countries *duplicitously* downplayed the power of political and econoimc nationalism at their own peril. p. 18
	* List derisively called free-traders advocates of *cosmopolitical economy*.
* In List's view, free-trade radicals and idealists promised that international trade liberalization would bring cheap food to the starving masses, prosperity for all, and even world peace.
* But List the realist claimed to see through this universalistic and pacifistic language.
* List believed all those flowery words to be a mere smokescreen.
* According to List, the true intention of Cobden and other free traders: to keep Britain as the *manufacturer for the world* in perpetuity.
* List warned that if the rest of the industrializing world listened to free-traders and threw open their domestic markets to open trade, Britain would maintain its hegemony by strangling rival nations' infant industries in the cradle.

#### Spread of List's ideas around the world
* List prescribed his Anglophobic protectionist product as a cure-all to counteract a British-dominated economic system. 
* He found an eager and quick reception around the world. p. 18
* List of languages and countries first translated/published on p. 19:
	1. 1843 - Hungary
	1. 1851 - France
	1. 1856 - USA
	1. 1860 - Australia
	1. 1885 - Britain
	1. 1887 - Romania
	1. 1888 - Sweden
	1. 1889 - Japan
	1. 1891 - Russia (Witte)

	1. 1926 - Bulgaria
	1. 1927 - China
	1. 1846/1935 - Finland

### Transimperial Exportation of the American System, 1861-1890
* p. 19 "From imperial metropole to colonial peripheries, the American System--rather than British-style free trade--became the economic model of choice."
* More on List on p. 19... esp. introducing his protectionist ideas to France in the early 1840s.

## Chapter 1 - The Imperialism of Economic Nationalism: Globalizing the American System p. 13
* p. 25 The growing popularity of the American System in the British settler colonies of Canada and Australia, coupled with the Long Depression (1873 - 1890s), gave succor to imperial protectionists in Britain itself.
* p. 25 British economic nationalists had feared speaking above a whisper in the 1860s - 70s owing to the hegemonic hold of the [free-trade] Manchester School (*aka* [Cobdenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cobden)). 
	* However, protectionist rumblings became a tumult by the late 1880s.
* Unsurprisingly, a British variant of the GHB (German Historical School -- a german variant of Henry Clay and Friederich List's American System) arose in the 1880s named the **English Historical School** (EHS). p. 25
* A capitalist manufacturer and Conservative politician from Birmingham, England named Sampson Samuel Lloyd published the first British translation of Friederich List's *The National System of Political Economy* in 1885. p. 25
