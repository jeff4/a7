## The Machinery Question
### Quotes
1. Dialogue / Q+A from The Pioneer 1833
1. Engels 'The Condition of the Working Class in England' (1845): *The history of the English working classes begins in the second half of the eighteenth century with the invention of the steam engine and of machines for spinning and weaving cotton. It is well known that these incentives gave the impetus to the genesis of industrial revolution.*
1. Marx 'Grundrisse' (1858): *The science which compels the inanimate limbs of the machinery, by their construction, to act purposefully, as an automaton, does not exist in the worker's consciousness, but rather acts upon him through the machine as an alien power, as the power of the machine itself.*

### How to question technology
1. It is commonly believed that the Industrial Revolution took English society by storm and transformed an economy of regular agricultural cycles into one of violent and unstable growth. 
1. For a long time, across the political spectrum, it has been accepted that capitalism began as *machine capitalism* and that even the making and destiny of the working class was tied to an industrial machine. 
1. Friedrich Engels himself declared this commonplace in the first line of *The Condition of the Working Class in England* (1845, quoted as an epigraph to this chapter). 
1. However, his collaboration with Karl Marx would radically challenge this apparently techno-deterministic view into one which recognised workers and the division of labour, rather than technology, as the main drivers of capitalist development. 
1. During the industrial age, machines came to supplant workers, dividing them into skilled and unskilled labourers, further separating mental from manual labour, and imposing new social hierarchies. 
1. Workers, however, resisted such division. 
1. They rebelled against machines and confronted their 'alien power', they discussed the role of machines, stormed factory floors to destroy them, and demanded, eventually, public education about them. 
1. The outcome of this outcry was the oftenforgotten 'Machinery Question', the public debate sparked in English society at this time upon the massive replacement of workers by new technologies.  
1. As a necessary prelude to the study of contemporary AI, this chapter aims to illuminate not just the social conflicts behind the Machinery Question but also the extended field of knowledge production around industrial machines and machine labour. 
1. Already during the industrial age, machines presented a problem of *machine intelligence* -- also nderstood as lack of collective knowledge about them. 
1. Besides its well-celebrated muscular, energetic, and thermodynamic exploits (documented by Anson Rabinbach in his book *The Human Motor*), industrial labour also entailed knowledge about machines, knowledge embodied by machines, and knowledge produced and projected anew by machines. 
1. This epistemic dimension of the industrial age, different from but related to its energetic one, is less investigated and appears always secondary in the vast literature of political economy (including Marxism). 
1. It is from this point of view -- which is to say from the perspective of knowledge production*, of the inquiry into the forms of knowledge of the industrial age -- that this chapter hopes to cast a different light on and pay respect to a century of hard labour.  
1. In her influential book *The Machinery Question and the Making of Political Economy*, historian Maxine Berg argues that at the time of the industrial age,
	* *machinery became the most immediate basis for the relationship between capitalist and worker.*
	* *It was the machine which defined the organisation of work and which held the balance of power in the determination of the distribution of returns from labour.* 
1. This is an egregious description of the field of forces, more precisely of the political battlefield, in which social and economic actors had to confront each other. 
1. Rather than a campaign of the industrialists, it must be immediately noted that the Machinery Question was first and foremost a reaction of the working class and an expression of its demand for control and ownership of technological progress. 
1. Berg writes:
	* *Workers criticised the rapid and unplanned introduction of new techniques in situations where the immediate result would be technological unemployment.*
	* *But they also went beyond this to challenge the uses and property relations of technology.*
	* *They demanded an equitable distribution of the gains from technical progress.*
	* *Rather than raising the profits of the few, the machine, they argued, might lighten the labour and increase the leisure of the many.*
	* *They also demanded greater control over the direction of technological change..*
	* *Technological progress should also be directed to changing the role of women in society, dispensing with the heavy manual labour and the household chores which prevented many women from claiming an equal position with men.*
1. The Machinery Question was canonically established by David Ricardo in the chapter 'On Machinery' that was added to the 1821 edition of his *Principles of Political Economy*. 
1. Ricardo's thesis was the following: while it was true that new machinery would cheapen commodity prices, nonetheless the working class would not benefit from this, since wages would be reduced by the competition among workers which is caused by technological unemployment. 
1. Berg adds that:
The [machinery] question was central to everyday relations between master and workman, but it was also of major theoretical and ideological interest. 
	* *The very technology at the basis of economy and society was a platform of challenge and struggle.*
	* *The machine was debated at length in all sectors of society.*
	* *It provoked the village cleric as much as it did the cosmopolitan intellectual; it concerned the politician as much as the workman and employer; the social reformer as much as scientist and inventor.*
	* *These groups contended over the costs and benefits of the new technology.*
	* *They hailed the release it provided from limits to growth, but disagreed over the impact it would have on wages, employment, and skill.*
	* *They speculated on, and then either welcomed or dreaded, the changes the machine would bring to social relations.*
	* *The origins and the ownership of machinery even came up for question.*
	* *There was excitement and fear at this unknown force which swept relentlessly onward, casting the old society in its wake.*
1. The Machinery Question was therefore a complex phenomenon: an issue of popular culture, political propaganda, scientific contestation, and social control through education. The machine became the site of an intellectual struggle and political occupation by radical thinkers, utopian industrialists, and socialist (and sometimes conservative) militants. 
1. The ideological struggle around machinery involved popular literature and pamphlets, poems and satires, and also the industrialists' celebration of a machine cult with dancing automata, 'mechanical Turks', and industrial engines set on display in public squares as tourist attractions. 
1. Charles Babbage was known for exhibiting a feminised dancing automaton in his salon, 'in the room next to the unfinished portion of the first Difference Engine'. 
1. As Berg has stressed, the rise of political economy as a new discipline was part of the intellectual struggle to control the Machinery Question.  
1. The response to the employment of machines and workers' subsequent technological unemployment was also the demand, by both workers and industrialists, for more knowledge about machines, for more education and better training, which took the form of the Mechanics' Institute movement, among other initiatives. 
1. The year 1823 saw the establishment of the London Mechanics' Institute, later known as Birkbeck University -- which still bears the Latin motto *In nocte consilium* ('Advice comes overnight'), as students were used (or, more accurately, forced) to attend evening and night courses after their daily shift at work. 
1. In 1826, Henry Brougham, future lord chancellor, founded the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge to help those who had no access to schooling, the same year that the London University (later University College London) was founded. 
1. The Owenite Hawkes Smith went so far as to forge mechanical metaphors for education: 'There is an *intellectual* machinery, a *mental steam power* at work, and still rising in its action which renders education proportionately as cheap and as attainable to the man of small means as his clothing and his domestic appointments.' 
1. It has indeed been forgotten how a good part of the British academic landscape finds its roots in the epistemic acceleration of the Industrial Revolution.  
1. Which *forms of knowledge* were debated under the auspices of the Machinery Question? 
1. Knowledge understood as skill and mechanical invention, applied rather than abstract science, was the mission of workers, engineers, educators, and industrialists. The Mechanics' Institutes were the incarnation of such a trend, searching, in Berg's words, for the 'optimal combination of science and skill ... 
1. a higher form of skilled labour, one freed from the degradation of the division of labour and imbued with creative and innovative instincts'. 
1. Everyone maintained that economic growth was bound to the invention of new machines and considered the *intellect as the machine within the machine*; however, the role of the intellect in this process was not then completely clear (and it is not yet today).  
1. In this debate, Marx was probably one of the most original and acute voices. 
1. He came to question the technological determinism according to which the machine would be the prime mover of industrial capitalism. 
1. Reversing the common perception of the relation between technology and economy, he argued that technological development (*the means of production*) is triggered by the division of labour (*the relations of production*) and not the other way around. 
1. According to Marx, capitalist accumulation is pushed by the exploitation of surplus value, by an ever- growing division of labour, rather than by technological acceleration. 
1. In his view, it was the emerging intelligence of the division of labour, the spontaneous and distributed cognition of masters and workers, which invents machines, not science per se. 
1. Science came into play only afterwards, to improve machines that emerged from a social configuration. 
1. For Marx, to be precise, the actual *alien power* that moves capitalism is not machinery but living labour.  
1. These sketches of the Machinery Question aim to reveal the full spectrum of social forces which lay behind the intellectual universe of the industrial age, rather than accept technological determinism as its main theory. Indeed, during that age a complex dialectics between social, technical, scientific, and cultural forms took place which cannot be reduced to any of them. 
1. The extended list of *knowledge models* and modalities of *knowledge production that crossed the industrial age should at least include: 
	1. the type of knowledge that is represented by the act of invention of a machine; 
	1. the division of labour that inspires its design; 
	1. the know-how of engineering and the symbolic language that is necessary to describe mechanism; 
	1. hard sciences such as mechanics and thermodynamics; 
	1. non-technical disciplines such as political economy; 
	1. the metrology of manual and mental labour and the instruments to measure them; 
	1. collective knowledge as embodied in both machinery and social relations (the so-called 'general intellect'); 
	1. educational movements such as the Mechanics' Institutes; 
	1. political campaigns such as the March of Intellect; 
	1. and, finally, popular mythologies around automata such as the Mechanical Turk. 
1. The Machinery Question contained all these contested forms of knowledge. 
1. This was not entirely a public history -- one of visible movements and effects -- but more often an anonymous history: one of invisibilisation (of women's labour, especially) and of political amnesia surrounding early notions of political economy such as mental labour.  
1. Against the spell of invisibilisation of the workforce, especially to better understand the demonisation of mental labour in the following century and the reason why mental labour disappeared from the debates on technology, this chapter expands, from opposite angles, upon the previous chapter's reflection on Babbage's labour theory of the machine. 
1. On the one hand, it illustrates the influence of knowledge in the definition of labour, framing a *knowledge theory of labour* (dear in the same way to nineteenth-century Ricardian socialists and twentieth-century knowledge economists). 
1. On the other hand, it illustrates the key influence of new machines and instruments on the development of new knowledge, expanding upon a *machine theory of science* that is key to the materialist epistemology of this booki.

### The knowledge theory of labour

1. The study of the relation between knowledge and labour has been complicated by the hegemony that science has maintained, in the modern era, in defining and enforcing social hierarchies. 
1. The epistemic imperialism of science institutions has obfuscated the role that labour, craftsmanship, experiments, and spontaneous forms of knowledge have played in technological change: it is still largely believed that only the application of science to industry can invent new technologies and prompt economic growth, while this is in fact rarely the case. 
1. Indeed, early nineteenth-century political economy already recognised the productive role of mental labour and the knowledge component of any form of manual labour in technological invention. 
1. Ricardian socialists such as William Thompson and Thomas Hodgskin, for instance, provided an analysis of mental labour that largely predates the theorists of the knowledge society of the twentieth century. 
1. Their position is illustrated, in this book, as a knowledge theory of labour, according to which the main component of labour is not muscular, physical, and energetic, but primarily psychological, intellectual, and informational.
