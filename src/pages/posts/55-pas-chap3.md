## The Machinery Question
### Quotes
1. Dialogue / Q+A from The Pioneer 1833
1. Engels 'The Condition of the Working Class in England' (1845): *The history of the English working classes begins in the second half of the eighteenth century with the invention of the steam engine and of machines for spinning and weaving cotton. It is well known that these incentives gave the impetus to the genesis of industrial revolution.*
1. Marx 'Grundrisse' (1858): *The science which compels the inanimate limbs of the machinery, by their construction, to act purposefully, as an automaton, does not exist in the worker's consciousness, but rather acts upon him through the machine as an alien power, as the power of the machine itself.*

### How to question technology
1. It is commonly believed that the Industrial Revolution took English society by storm and transformed an economy of regular agricultural cycles into one of violent and unstable growth. 
1. For a long time, across the political spectrum, it has been accepted that capitalism began as machine capitalism and that even the making and destiny of the working class was tied to an industrial machine. 
1. Friedrich Engels himself declared this commonplace in the first line of The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845, quoted as an epigraph to this chapter). 
1. However, his collaboration with Karl Marx would radically challenge this apparently techno-deterministic view into one which recognised workers and the division of labour, rather than technology, as the main drivers of capitalist development. 
1. During the industrial age, machines came to supplant workers, dividing them into skilled and unskilled labourers, further separating mental from manual labour, and imposing new social hierarchies. 
1. Workers, however, resisted such division. 
1. They rebelled against machines and confronted their 'alien power', they discussed the role of machines, stormed factory floors to destroy them, and demanded, eventually, public education about them. 
1. The outcome of this outcry was the oftenforgotten 'Machinery Question', the public debate sparked in English society at this time upon the massive replacement of workers by new technologies.  
1. As a necessary prelude to the study of contemporary AI, this chapter aims to illuminate not just the social conflicts behind the Machinery Question but also the extended field of knowledge production around industrial machines and machine labour. 
1. Already during the industrial age, machines presented a problem of machine intelligence -- also nderstood as lack of collective knowledge about them. 
1. Besides its well-celebrated muscular, energetic, and thermodynamic exploits (documented by Anson Rabinbach in his book The Human Motor), industrial labour also entailed knowledge about machines, knowledge embodied by machines, and knowledge produced and projected anew by machines. 
1. This epistemic dimension of the industrial age, different from but related to its energetic one, is less investigated and appears always secondary in the vast literature of political economy (including Marxism). 
1. It is from this point of view -- which is to say from the perspective of knowledge production, of the inquiry into the forms of knowledge of the industrial age -- that this chapter hopes to cast a different light on and pay respect to a century of hard labour.  
1. In her influential book The Machinery Question and the Making of Political Economy, historian Maxine Berg argues that at the time of the industrial age,
	* *machinery became the most immediate basis for the relationship between capitalist and worker.*
	* *It was the machine which defined the organisation of work and which held the balance of power in the determination of the distribution of returns from labour.* <sup>7</sup>
