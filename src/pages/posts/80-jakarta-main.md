## Introduction
1. p. 2 - In mid-60's, "officials in DC and journalists in NYC...knew that Indonesia was a far more important prize than Vietnam ever could have been."
	* Both Indonesia and Brazil 'had been independent, standing somewhere in between [the First World and the Second World], but fell decisively into the US camp by before the late 1960s'.
	* 'In just a few months, the US foreign policy establishment achieved in Indonesia what it failed to get done in ten bloody years of war in Indochina.
	* 'The dictatorship in Brazil, [as of 2020] the fifth most populous country, played a crucial role in pushing the rest of South America into the pro-Washington, anticommunist group of nations.'
	* 'In both countries, the Soviet Union was barely involved.'
1. p. 257, Footnote 6 to Introduction. Key resource is [The Global Cold War](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/global-cold-war/frontmatter/3F0FBC31BA7AFB62A6FFEA9EDEE6A5B3), published in 2005 by Cambridge University Press by Norwegian historian [Odd Arne Westad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Arne_Westad) who moved to Yale in 2019. Previously, Westad had taught at Harvard Kennedy School, LSE, and the University of Oslo. 
	* From his bio on Wikipedia: "Westad is particularly known for his re-evaluation of the history of the Cold War. His interpretation emphasizes the role of the conflict on a global scale, and not just in Europe or North America. He also underlines the ideological origins of the Cold War and the long-term effects it had in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The term 'global Cold War' is often associated with Westad's work, and has been taken up by many historians and social scientists."

1. Indonesian head of the army General Nasution told US Ambassador 'Smiling' Howard Jones that the military would never allow the PKI (Indonesia Communist Party) to join the government. 
1. In reality, the three political forces in Indonesia were not Nationalism (*Nasionalisme*), Agama (*Religion*), Communism (*Komunisme*); the real tripod was the PKI, Sukarno, and the Military.
1. p.114 Unlike in Brazil, fanatical anticommunism did not have widespread support in Indonesian society. 
1. Despite what military leaders said to Americans in private, they were not opposed to the left in general, and they often echoed Sukarno's revolutionary language in their literature and public statements. 
1. The entire country was essentially anti-imperialist, by definition.
1. In early 1963, the countries from the 1955 Bandung conference founded the Afro-Asian Journalist Association at a conference in Jakarta.

	* The PKI now had 3m card-carrying members.
	* Nearly 33% of the country's adult registered voters were PKI affiliates.
	* Given 100m population including children, it's very impressive that 20m Indonesians belonged to PKI-associated organizations: [SOBSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_All-Indonesian_Workers_Organization), [LEKRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lembaga_Kebudajaan_Rakjat), [Farmer's Alliance BTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants_Front_of_Indonesia), [People's Youth *Pemuda Rakyat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Youth_(Indonesia)), 
nd [Indonesian Women's Movement *Gerwani*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerwani).
1. The PKI operated openly and throughout the geography of Indonesia but at the national level, they relied almost entirely on Sukarno b/c of the Guided Democracy Policy.
	* The PKI had neither arms nor the ballot-box.
	* The PKI ahd been peaceful since the expulsion of the Dutch.
	* Remember, they were denied access to votes b/c the US Army had been so alarmed by the popularity of the PKI during elections.

	* Sukarno's 1958 revolution had bested the CIA
	* He had succeeded in convincing JFK and the Netherlands in backing down over West New Guinea / Papua.
	* With US intervention in Brazil and escalation in Vietnam, Sukarno had more evidence that the US was an imperialist aggressor.
