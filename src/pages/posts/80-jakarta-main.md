## Introduction
1. p. 2 - In mid-60's, "officials in DC and journalists in NYC...knew that Indonesia was a far more important prize than Vietnam ever could have been."
	* Both Indonesia and Brazil 'had been independent, standing somewhere in between [the First World and the Second World], but fell decisively into the US camp by before the late 1960s'.
	* 'In just a few months, the US foreign policy establishment achieved in Indonesia what it failed to get done in ten bloody years of war in Indochina.
	* 'The dictatorship in Brazil, [as of 2020] the fifth most populous country, played a crucial role in pushing the rest of South America into the pro-Washington, anticommunist group of nations.'
	* 'In both countries, the Soviet Union was barely involved.'
1. p. 257, Footnote 6 to Introduction. Key resource is [The Global Cold War](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/global-cold-war/frontmatter/3F0FBC31BA7AFB62A6FFEA9EDEE6A5B3), published in 2005 by Cambridge University Press by Norwegian historian [Odd Arne Westad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Arne_Westad) who moved to Yale in 2019. Previously, Westad had taught at Harvard Kennedy School, LSE, and the University of Oslo. 
	* From his bio on Wikipedia: "Westad is particularly known for his re-evaluation of the history of the Cold War. His interpretation emphasizes the role of the conflict on a global scale, and not just in Europe or North America. He also underlines the ideological origins of the Cold War and the long-term effects it had in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The term 'global Cold War' is often associated with Westad's work, and has been taken up by many historians and social scientists."
