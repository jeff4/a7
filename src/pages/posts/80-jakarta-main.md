## Introduction
1. p. 2 - In mid-60's, "officials in DC and journalists in NYC...knew that Indonesia was a far more important prize than Vietnam ever could have been."
	* Both Indonesia and Brazil 'had been independent, standing somewhere in between [the First World and the Second World], but fell decisively into the US camp by before the late 1960s'.
	* 'In just a few months, the US foreign policy establishment achieved in Indonesia what it failed to get done in ten bloody years of war in Indochina.
	* 'The dictatorship in Brazil, [as of 2020] the fifth most populous country, played a crucial role in pushing the rest of South America into the pro-Washington, anticommunist group of nations.'
	* 'In both countries, the Soviet Union was barely involved.'
1. p. 257, Footnote 6 to Introduction. Key resource is [The Global Cold War](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/global-cold-war/frontmatter/3F0FBC31BA7AFB62A6FFEA9EDEE6A5B3), published in 2005 by Cambridge University Press by Norwegian historian [Odd Arne Westad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Arne_Westad) who moved to Yale in 2019. Previously, Westad had taught at Harvard Kennedy School, LSE, and the University of Oslo. 
	* From his bio on Wikipedia: "Westad is particularly known for his re-evaluation of the history of the Cold War. His interpretation emphasizes the role of the conflict on a global scale, and not just in Europe or North America. He also underlines the ideological origins of the Cold War and the long-term effects it had in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The term 'global Cold War' is often associated with Westad's work, and has been taken up by many historians and social scientists."

## Chapter 6: The September 30th Movement
1. Indonesia, September 1965 Indonesia
1. In early 1960s, Sukarno visited Fidel and Che Guevara in Havana. Indonesia and Cuba began working on a 'tricontinental' conference which would expand the 1955 Afro-Asian conference to begin including Latin America. 'The entire Third World united.' p. 113
1. New Sukarno acronym / neologism [NASAKOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasakom). Part of [Guided Democracy Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_Democracy_in_Indonesia)
	* Nasionalisme, Agama, Komunisme aka Nationalism, Religion, and Communism
1. Indonesian head of the army General Nasution told US Ambassador 'Smiling' Howard Jones that the military would never allow the PKI (Indonesia Communist Party) to join the government. 
1. In reality, the three political forces in Indonesia were not Nationalism (*Nasionalisme*), Agama (*Religion*), Communism (*Komunisme*); the real tripod was the PKI, Sukarno, and the Military.
1. p.114 Unlike in Brazil, fanatical anticommunism did not have widespread support in Indonesian society. 
1. Despite what military leaders said to Americans in private, they were not opposed to the left in general, and they often echoed Sukarno's revolutionary language in their literature and public statements. 
1. The entire country was essentially anti-imperialist, by definition.
1. In early 1963, the countries from the 1955 Bandung conference founded the Afro-Asian Journalist Association at a conference in Jakarta.
	* Francesca joined the resulting *Afro-Asian Journalist* magazine.
1. [GANEFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GANEFO) which ran from 1962-1967, was a Third World competitor to the Olympic Games. "GAmes of the New Emerging FOrces". 
	* GANEFO originally came about when Indonesia excluded Taiwan and Israel from the [1962 Asian Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_Asian_Games). p. 114
1. p.115 PKI at this point was the third most populous Communist party in the world after the USSR and China.
	* The PKI's strategy of nonviolent, direct engagement with the masses had led to impressive results.
	* The PKI now had 3m card-carrying members.
	* Nearly 33% of the country's adult registered voters were PKI affiliates.
	* Given 100m population including children, it's very impressive that 20m Indonesians belonged to PKI-associated organizations: [SOBSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_All-Indonesian_Workers_Organization), [LEKRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lembaga_Kebudajaan_Rakjat), [Farmer's Alliance BTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants_Front_of_Indonesia), [People's Youth *Pemuda Rakyat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Youth_(Indonesia)), 
nd [Indonesian Women's Movement *Gerwani*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerwani).
1. The PKI operated openly and throughout the geography of Indonesia but at the national level, they relied almost entirely on Sukarno b/c of the Guided Democracy Policy.
	* The PKI had neither arms nor the ballot-box.
	* The PKI ahd been peaceful since the expulsion of the Dutch.
	* Remember, they were denied access to votes b/c the US Army had been so alarmed by the popularity of the PKI during elections.
1. p. 116. On the other hand, the military was allied with Muslim groups and increasingly the US. 
1. Political camps: (a)  Sukarno + PKI on one side; (b) Army and the West on the other.
1. Sukarno no longer felt shyness about taking on the West. 
	* Sukarno's 1958 revolution had bested the CIA
	* He had succeeded in convincing JFK and the Netherlands in backing down over West New Guinea / Papua.
	* With US intervention in Brazil and escalation in Vietnam, Sukarno had more evidence that the US was an imperialist aggressor. 

### Confrontation with the UK on the creation of Malaysia

1. Konfrontasi
1. p. 116 One of the last British colonies in Asia was Malaya. London was now decolonizing it and creating the country of Malaysia.

### The end of the Smiling Jones Method
1. LBJ took a different approach than JFK did.
1. p. 120 'Just 3 days before his death, JFK reiterated his clear, if slightly cynical, commitment to the strategy of ongoing engagement with Sukarno--the very strategy that Smiling JOnes had long been advocating.
	* 'According to White House aide Michael Forrestal, JFK said "Indonesia is a nation of 100m with perhaps more resources than any other nation in Asia...It doesn't make any sense for the US to go out of our way to permanently alenate this large group of people sitting on thses resources unless there is some very,very persuasive reason."
	* '*Konfrontasi* was not enough for JFK to abandon Sukarno and Smiling Jones.'
1. In contrast, LBJ was not interested in direct engagement with Indonesia; he did not want to spend political capital pushing Asia policies that were unpopular in Congress.
1. Howard Jones reminisces about the attitutinal and policy shift between the JFK and LBJ administrations towards Indonesia:
	* "Regarding himself as the leader not only of the new Asian-African nations but all the *new emerging forces* [of the Third World], I am sure that Sukarno felt that an understanding at least (if not a full on alliance) was possible between himself and the man considered the leader of the Western world.
	* "Sukarno was being wooed by Khrushchev and Mao--why, then, should not the leader of the other world bloc be equally interested in working with him?"
1. Jones believed Sukarno would back off on Malaysia as long as that did not mean national humliation; he told JFK a presidential visit to Indonesia would probably just what was needed.
	* Kennedy agreed and planned to come.
	* But a few months after JFK's death, Jones asked LBJ to sign an official determiniation that continued aid to Indonesia was in the national interest. 
	* LBJ declined.
1. Howard Jones: "JFK, i knew, would have signed the determination almost as matter of course of routine. It was disappointing."
1. In December, 1963, Robert McNamara began suggesting aggressive curtailment of aid. It was the end of the Indonesia policy that Jones had been cultivating for a decade.
1. LBJ made a deal with the British. In exchange for the UK's support in Vietnam escalation, the US would back the UK in the creation of Malaysia.
1. Rising anti-American sentiment and policies in Indonesia b/c of LBJ's brush-off and Washington DC's support of the British in Malaysia.

### Gulf of Tonkin Incident
1. p. 123. Three days after Gulf of Tonkin, Sukarno defiantly established relations with Ho Chi Minh's government in North Vietnam.
1. Sukarno to Jones: "I think your Asian policy is wrong. It is not popular with Asian people generally. It looks to them as if you are interfering with the affairs of the Asian nations...Why should you become involved?"
1. Needless to say, Sukarno's support of North Vietnam was 'a scandalous position in DC'.
1. But most Indonesians agreed with Sukarno. To people like Francisca and Sakono and Magdalena, the Vietnamese were fighting for national independence.

### End of US Ambassador to Indonesia Howard Jones' tenure
1. Warm send-off by Indonesians
1. What did the US press say at the time? After Jones announced his departure from Indonesia,
	* *The Washington Post*: Jones is Sukarno's pal, a man who is almost angelically naive. In a article with a lot of quotes from critics of Jones.
	* *The Los Angeles Times*: Headline asking if "Jones was a patsy?"

### Clandestine Operations
1. p. 124 When Jones' diplomatic approach collapsed, both the US and the British governments escalated secret activities in Indonesia.
1. Their full nature is still hidden to us, but they included 'black ops' and preparations for psychological warfare.
