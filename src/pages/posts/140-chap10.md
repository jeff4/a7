## Part II / Chapter 10 / From *Kritische Geschichte*

1. Finally, let us take a glance at the *Kritische Geschichte der Nationalökonomie*, at 'that enterprise' of Herr Dühring's which, as he says, 'is absolutely without precedent'. 
1. It may be that here at last we shall find the definitive and most strictly scientific treatment which he has so often promised us.
1. Herr Dühring makes a great deal of noise over his discovery that '*economic science* is an enormously modern phenomenon.'
1. In fact, Marx says in Capital: 'Political economy...as an independent science, first sprang into being during the period of manufacture'; 
	* and in *Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie*, page 29, that 'classical political economy...dates from William Petty in England and Boisguillebert in France, 
	* and closes with Ricardo in the former country and Sismondi in the latter'. 
1. Herr Dühring follows the path thus laid down for him, except that in his view *higher* economics begins only with the wretched abortions brought into existence by bourgeois science after the close of its classical period. 

***

1. On the other hand, he is fully justified in triumphantly proclaiming at the end of his introduction: 'But if this enterprise, in its externally appreciable peculiarities and in the more novel portion of its content, is absolutely without precedent, in its inner critical approaches and its general standpoint, it is even more peculiarly mine'. 
1. It is a fact that, on the basis of both its external and its internal features, he might very well have announced his 'enterprise' (the industrial term is not badly chosen) as: *The Ego and His Own* [an oblique reference to Stirner’s book]. 
1. Since political economy, as it made its appearance in history, is in fact nothing but the scientific insight into the economy in the period of capitalist production, principles and theorems relating to it, for example, in the writers of ancient Greek society, can only be found in so far as certain phenomena--commodity production, trade, money, interest-bearing capital, etc.--are common to both societies. 
1. In so far as the Greeks make occasional excursions into this sphere, they show the same genius and originality as in all other spheres. 
1. Because of this, their views form, historically, the theoretical starting-points of the modern science. 
1. Let us now listen to what the world-historic Herr Dühring has to say. 
	* 'We have, strictly speaking, really [!] absolutely nothing positive to report of antiquity concerning scientific economic theory, and the completely unscientific Middle Ages give still less occasion for this...*[ for this--reporting* nothing! *]*...
	* ...As however the fashion of vaingloriously displaying a semblance of erudition...has defaced the true character of modern science, notice must be taken of at least a few examples.' 
1. And Herr Dühring then produces examples of a criticism which is in truth free from even the 'semblance of erudition'.

***

1. Aristotle's thesis, that:
	* *'twofold is the use of every object...*
	* *'The one is peculiar to the object as such, the other is not, as a sandal which may be worn, and is also exchangeable.* 
	* *'Both are uses of the sandal, for even he who exchanges the sandal for the money or food he is in want of, makes use of the sandal as a sandal.* 
	* *'But not in its natural way.* 
	* *'For it has not been made for the sake of being exchanged* [this thesis, Herr Dühring maintains] *is not only expressed in a really platitudinous and scholastic way;* 
	* *'but those who see in it a differentiation between use-value and exchange-value fall besides into the ridiculous frame of mind of forgetting that in the most recent period and in the framework of the most advanced system'*--
1. --which of course is Herr Dühring's own system--nothing has been left of use-value and exchange-value.

***

1. 'In Plato’s work on the state, people...claim to have found the modern doctrine of the national-economic division of labour.'
1. This was apparently meant to refer to the passage in *Capital*, Ch. XII, 5 (p. 369 of the third edition), where the views of classical antiquity on the division of labour are on the contrary shown to have been 'in most striking contrast' with the modern view. 
1. Herr Dühring has nothing but sneers for Plato's presentation--one which, for his time, was full of genius--of the division of labour as the natural basis of the city (which for the Greeks was identical with the state); 
1. and this on the ground that he did not mention--though the Greek Xenophon did, Herr Dühring--
	* *'the limit set by the given dimensions of the market to the further differentiation of professions and the technical subdivision of special operations...'*
	* *'Only the conception of this limit constitutes the knowledge with the aid of which this idea, otherwise hardly fit to be called scientific, becomes a major economic truth'.*

***

1. It was in fact *Professor* Roscher, of whom Herr Dühring is so contemptuous, who set up this 'limit' at which the idea of the division of labour is supposed first to become 'scientific', and who therefore expressly pointed to Adam Smith as the discoverer of the law of the division of labour. 
1. In a society in which commodity production is the dominant form of production, 'the market'--to adopt Herr Dühring’s style for once--was always a 'limit' very well known to 'business people'. 
1. But more than 'the knowledge and instinct of routine' is needed to realise that it was not the market that created the capitalist division of labour, but that, on the contrary, it was the dissolution of former social connections, and the division of labour resulting from this, that created the market (see *Capital*, Vol. I, Ch. XXIV). 
1. 'The role of money has at all times provided the first and main stimulus to economic (!) ideas.' 
1. 'But what did an Aristotle know of this role?' 
1. 'No more, clearly than was contained in the idea that exchange through the medium of money had followed the primitive exchange by barter'.

***

1. But when 'an' Aristotle presumes to discover the two different forms of the circulation of money--the one in which it operates as a mere medium of circulation, and the other in which it operates as money capital, he is thereby-–according to Herr Dühring--'only expressing a moral antipathy'.
1. And when 'an' Aristotle carries his audacity so far as to attempt an analysis of money in its 'role' of a measure of value, and actually states this problem, which has such decisive importance for the theory of money, correctly--then 'a' Dühring prefers (and for very good private reasons) to say nothing about such impermissible temerity.
1. Final result: Greek antiquity, as mirrored in the 'notice taken' by Dühring, in fact possessed 'only quite ordinary ideas', if such 'niaiserie' has anything whatever in common with ideas, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
1. It would be better to read Herr Dühring's chapter on mercantilism in the 'original', that is, in **F. List's** *Nationales System*, Chapter 29. 
1. How carefully Herr Dühring manages to avoid here too any 'semblance of erudition' is shown by the following passage, among others:
	* **List, Chapter 28:** says:
		* *'Italy was in advance of all modern nations both in the practice and in the theory of political economy,*'
		* and then he cites, as *'the first work written in Italy, which deals especially with political economy, the book by Antonio Serra, of Naples, on the way to secure for the kingdoms an abundance of gold and silver (1613)'*.
1. Herr Dühring confidently accepts this and is therefore able to regard Serra's *Breve trattato* 'as a kind of inscription at the entrance of the more recent prehistory of economics'.

***

1. His treatment of the *Breve trattato* is in fact limited to this 'piece of literary buffoonery'. 
1. Unfortunately, the actual facts of the case were different: in 1609, that is four years before the *Breve trattato*, Thomas Mun's *A Discourse of Trade etc.*, had appeared. 
1. The particular significance of this book was that, even in its first edition, it was directed against the original *monetary system* which was then still defended in England as being the policy of the state; hence it represented the conscious *self-separation* of the mercantile system from the system which gave it birth. 
1. Even in the form in which it first appeared the book had several editions and exercised a direct influence on legislation. 
1. In the edition of 1664 (*England's Treasure etc.*), which had been completely rewritten by the author and was published after his death, it continued to be the mercantilist gospel for another hundred years. 
1. If mercantilism therefore has an epoch-making work 'as a kind of inscription at the entrance', it is this book, and for this very reason it simply does not exist for Herr Dühring's 'history which most carefully observes the distinctions of rank'.


***


1. **Of *Petty*, the founder of modern political economy, Herr Dühring tells us that there was:**
	* *'a fair measure of superficiality in his way of thinking'*
	* and that *'he had no sense of the intrinsic and nicer distinctions between concepts...'*
	* while he possessed *'a versatility which knows a great deal but skips lightly from one thing to another without taking root in any idea of a more profound character*,...
	* his *'national-economic ideas are still very crude'*, 
	* and *'he achieves naivetés, whose contrasts...a more serious thinker may well find amusing at times'*.
1. What inestimable condescension, therefore, for the 'more serious thinker' Herr Dühring to deign to take any notice at all of 'a Petty'! 
1. And what notice does he take of him?
1. Petty's propositions on 'labour and even labour-time as a measure of value, of which *imperfect traces* can be found in his writings' are not mentioned again apart from this sentence. 
1. **Imperfect traces!** 
1. In his *Treatise on Taxes and Contributions* (first edition 1662), Petty gives a perfectly clear and correct analysis of the magnitude of value of commodities. 
1. In illustrating this magnitude at the outset by the equal value of precious metals and corn on which the same quantity of labour has been expended, he says the first and the last 'theoretical' word on the value of the precious metals. 
1. But he also lays it down in a definite and general form that the values of commodities must be measured by equal labour. 
1. He applies his discovery to the solution of various problems, some of which are very intricate, and on various occasions and in various works, even where he does not repeat the fundamental proposition, he draws important conclusions from it. 

***

1. But even in his very first work he says:
	* *'This [estimation by equal labour] I say to be the foundation of equalizing and balancing of values, yet in the superstructures and practices hereupon, I confess there is much variety, and intricacy.'*
1. Petty was thus conscious equally of the importance of his discovery and of the difficulty of applying it in detail. He therefore tried to find another way in certain concrete cases.
	* 'A *natural par* should therefore be found between land and labour, so that value might be expressed at will by either of them alone as well or better by both'.
1. Even this error has genius.
1. Herr Dühring makes this penetrating observation on Petty's theory of value:
'Had his own thought been more penetrating it would not be possible to find, in other passages, traces of a contrary view, to which we have previously referred'...
1. ...that is to say, to which no 'previous' reference has been made except that the 'traces' are 'imperfect'. 
1. *This is very characteristic of Herr Dühring's method*--to allude to something 'previously' in a meaningless phrase, in order 'subsequently' to make the reader believe that he has 'previously' been made acquainted with the main point, **which in fact the author in question has slid over both previously and subsequently.**

***

1. In Adam Smith, however, we can find not only 'traces' of 'contrary views' on the concept of value, not only two but even three, and strictly speaking even four sharply contrary opinions on value, running quite comfortably side by side and intermingled. 
1. But what is quite natural in a writer who is laying the foundations of political economy and is necessarily feeling his way, experimenting and struggling with a chaos of ideas which are only just taking shape, may seem strange in a writer who is surveying and summarising more than a hundred and fifty years of investigation whose results have already passed in part from books into the consciousness of the generality. 
1. And, to pass from great things to small: as we have seen, Herr Dühring himself gives us five different kinds of value to select from at will, and with them, an equal number of contrary views. 
1. Of course, 'had his own thought been more penetrating', he would not have had to expend so much effort in trying to throw his readers back from Petty's perfectly clear conception of value into the uttermost confusion. 
1. A smoothly finished work of Petty’s which may be said to be cast in a single block, is his *Quantulumcunque concerning Money*, published in 1682, ten years after his *Anatomy of Ireland* (*this* 'first' appeared in 1672, not 1691 as stated by Herr Dühring, who takes it second-hand from the 'most current textbook compilations'). 
1. In this book the last vestiges of mercantilist views, found in other writings by him, have completely disappeared. 
1. In content and form it is a little masterpiece, and for this very reason Herr Dühring does not even mention its title. 
1. It is quite in the order of things that in relation to the most brilliant and original of economic investigators, our vainglorious and pedantic mediocrity should only snarl his displeasure, and take offence at the fact that the flashes of theoretical thought do not proudly parade about in rank and file as ready-made 'axioms', but merely rise sporadically to the surface from the depths of 'crude' practical material, for example, of taxes.

***

1. Petty's foundations of *Political Arithmetic*, *vulgo* statistics, are treated by Herr Dühring in the same way as that author’s specifically economic works. 
1. He malevolently shrugs his shoulders at the odd methods used by Petty! 
1. Considering the grotesque methods still employed in this field a century later even by Lavoisier, and in view of the great distance that separates even contemporary statistics from the goal which Petty assigned to them in broad outline, such self-satisfied superiority two centuries *post festum* stands out in all its undisguised stupidity. 
1. Petty’s most important ideas--which received such scant attention in Herr Dühring's 'enterprise'--are, in the latter's view, nothing but disconnected conceits, chance thoughts, incidental comments, to which only in our day a significance is given, by the use of excerpts torn from their context, which in themselves they have not got; which therefore also play no part in the *real* history of political economy, but only in modern books below the standard of Herr Dühring's deep-rooted criticism and 'historical depiction in the grand style'. 
1. In his 'enterprise', he seems to have had in view a circle of readers who would have implicit faith and would never be bold enough to ask for proof of his assertions. 

***

1. We shall return to this point soon (when dealing with Locke and North), but must first take a fleeting glance at Boisguillebert and Law. 
1. In connection with the former, we must draw attention to the sole find made by Herr Dühring: he has discovered a connection between Boisguillebert and Law which had hitherto been missed. 
1. Boisguillebert asserts that the precious metals could be replaced, in the normal monetary functions which they fulfil in commodity circulation, by credit money (*un morceau de papier*). 
1. Law on the other hand imagines that any 'increase' whatever in the number of these 'pieces of paper' increases the wealth of a nation. 
1. Herr Dühring draws from this the conclusion that Boisguillebert’s 'turn of thought already harboured a new turn in mercantilism' in other words, already included Law. 
1. This is made as clear as daylight in the following: *'All that was necessary was to assign to the* simple pieces of paper *the same role that the precious metals should have played, and a metamorphosis of mercantilism was thereby at once accomplished'*.
1. In the same way it is possible to accomplish at once the metamorphosis of an uncle into an aunt. 
1. It is true that Herr Dühring adds appealingly: *'Of course Boisguillebert had no such purpose in mind'.*
1. But how, in the devil’s name, could he intend to replace his own rationalist conception of the monetary function of the precious metals by the superstitious conception of the mercantilists for the sole reason that, according to him, the precious metals can be replaced in this role by paper money?
1. Nevertheless, Herr Dühring continues in his serio-comic style, *'nevertheless it may be conceded that here and there our author succeeded in making a really apt remark'*.
1. In reference to Law, Herr Dühring succeeded in making only this 'really apt remark':
	* *Law too was naturally never able completely to eradicate the above-named basis* [namely, 'the basis of the precious metals'], *but he pushed the issue of notes to its extreme limit, that is to say, to the collapse of the system.*
1. In reality, however, these paper butterflies, mere money tokens, were intended to flutter about among the public, not in order to “eradicate” the basis of the precious metals, but to entice them from the pockets of the public into the depleted treasuries of the state. 

***

1. To return to Petty and the inconspicuous role in the history of economics assigned to him by Herr Dühring, let us first listen to what we are told about Petty’s immediate successors, Locke and North. 
1. Locke’s *Considerations on Lowering of Interest and Raising of Money*, and North’s *Discourses upon Trade*, appeared in the same year, 1691.

***

1. 'What [Locke] wrote on interest and coin does not go beyond the range of the reflections, current under the dominion of mercantilism, in connection with the events of political life'. 
1. To the reader of this 'report' it should now be clear as crystal why Locke's *Lowering of Interest* had such an important influence, in more than one direction, on political economy in France and Italy during the latter half of the eighteenth century.
	* *'Many businessmen thought the same [as Locke] on free play for the rate of interest, and the developing situation also produced the tendency to regard restrictions on interest as ineffective.* 
	* *'At a period when a Dudley North could write his* Discourses upon Trade *in the direction of free trade, a great deal must already have been in the air, as they say, which made the theoretical opposition to restrictions on interest rates seem something not at all extraordinary.'*
1. So Locke had only to cogitate the ideas of this or that contemporary 'businessman', or to breathe in a great deal of what was 'in the air, as they say' to be able to theorise on free play for the rate of interest without saying anything 'extraordinary'! 
1. In fact, however, as early as 1662, in his *Treatise on Taxes and Contributions*, Petty had counterposed interest, as rent of money which we call usury to rent of land and houses, and lectured the landlords, who wished to keep down by legislation not of course land rent, but the rent of money, on the vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive law against the law of nature. 
1. In his *Quantulumcunque* (1682) he therefore declared that legislative regulation of the rate of interest was as stupid as regulation of exports of precious metals or regulation of exchange rates. 
1. In the same work he made statements of unquestionable authority on the raising of money (for example, the attempt to give sixpence the name of one shilling by doubling the number of shillings coined from one ounce of silver).
1. As regards this last point, Locke and North did little more than copy him. 
1. In regard to interest, however, Locke followed Petty’s parallel between rent of money and rent of land, while North goes further and opposes interest as rent of stock to land rent, and the stocklords to the landlords. 
1. And while Locke accepts free play for the rate of interest, as demanded by Petty, only with reservations, North accepts it unconditionally. 
1. Herr Dühring–-himself still a bitter mercantilist in the 'more subtle' sense--surpasses himself when he dismisses Dudley North’s *Discourses upon Trade* with the comment that they were written 'in the direction of free trade'. 
1. It is rather like saying of Harvey that he wrote 'in the direction' of the circulation of the blood. 
1. North's work--apart from its other merits–is a classical exposition, driven home with relentless logic, of the doctrine of free trade, both foreign and internal--certainly 'something extraordinary' in the year 1691!

***

1. Herr Dühring, by the way, informs us that: 'North was a "merchant" [and a bad type at that, also that his work] met with no approval'. 
1. Indeed! How could anyone expect a book of this sort to have met with 'approval' among the mob setting the tone at the time of the final triumph of protectionism in England? 
1. But this did not prevent it from having an immediate effect on theory, as can be seen from a whole series of economic works published in England shortly after it, some of them even before the end of the seventeenth century. 
1. Locke and North gave us proof of how the first bold strokes which Petty dealt in almost every sphere of political economy were taken up one by one by his English successors and further developed. 
1. The traces of this process during the period 1691 to 1752 are obvious even to the most superficial observer from the very fact that all the more important economic writings of that time start from Petty, either positively or negatively. 
1. That period, which abounded in original thinkers, is therefore the most important for the investigation of the gradual genesis of political economy. 
1. The 'historical depiction in the grand style', which chalks up against Marx the unpardonable sin of making so much commotion in *Capital* about Petty and the writers of that period, simply strikes them right out of history. 
1. From Locke, North, Boisguillebert and Law it jumps straight to the physiocrats, and then, at the entrance to the real temple of political economy, appears--David Hume. 
1. With Herr Dühring's permission, however, we restore the chronological order, putting Hume before the physiocrats.
1. Hume’s economic *Essays* appeared in 1752. 
1. In the related essays: *of Money*, *of the Balance of Trade*, *of Commerce*, Hume follows step by step, and often even in his personal idiosyncrasies, Jacob Vanderlint’s *Money Answers All Things*, published in London in 1734. 
1. However unknown this Vanderlint may have been to Herr Dühring, references to him can be found in English economic works even at the end of the eighteenth century, that is to say, in the period after Adam Smith. 
1. Like Vanderlint, Hume treated money as a mere token of value; he copied almost word for word (and this is important as he might have taken the theory of money as a token of value from many other sources)... 
1. ...Vanderlint's argument on why the balance of trade cannot be permanently either favourable or unfavourable to a country; 
	* *like Vanderlint, he teaches that the equilibrium of balances is brought about naturally, in accordance with the different economic situations in the different countries;*
	* *like Vanderlint, he preaches free trade, but less boldly and consistently;*
	* *like Vanderlint, though with less profundity, he emphasises wants as the motive forces of production;*
	* *he follows Vanderlint in the influence on commodity prices which he erroneously attributes to bank money and government securities in general;*
	* *like Vanderlint, he rejects credit money;*
	* *like Vanderlint, he makes commodity prices dependent on the price of labour, that is, on wages;*
	* *he even copies Vanderlint’s absurd notion that by accumulating treasures commodity prices are kept down, etc., etc.*
1. At a much earlier point Herr Dühring made an oracular allusion to how others had misunderstood Hume's monetary theory with a particularly minatory reference to Marx, who in *Capital* had, besides, pointed in a manner contrary to police regulations to the secret connections of Hume with Vanderlint and with J. 
1. Massie, who will be mentioned later. 
1. As for this misunderstanding, the facts are as follows. 
1. In regard to Hume’s real theory of money (that money is a mere token of value, and therefore, other conditions being equal, commodity prices rise in proportion to the increase in the volume of money in circulation, and fall in proportion to its decrease),... 
	* *Herr Dühring*, with the best intentions in the world--though in his own luminous way--*can only repeat the errors made by his predecessors*. 

***

1. Hume, however, after propounding the theory cited above, himself raises the objection (as Montesquieu, starting from the same premises, had done previously) that: 
	* *"Nevertheless 'tis certain [that since the discovery of the mines in America,] industry has encreased in all the nations of Europe, except in the possessors of those mines, [and that this] may justly be ascribed, amongst other reasons, to the encrease of gold and silver."*
1. His explanation of this phenomenon is that
	* *though the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of the encrease of gold and silver, yet it follows not immediately upon that encrease;*
	* *but some time is required before the money circulate through the whole state, and make its effects be felt on all ranks of people.*
	* *In this interval it has a beneficial effect on industry and trade.*
1. At the end of this analysis Hume also tells us why this is so, although in a less comprehensive way than many of his predecessors and contemporaries:
	* *‘Tis easy to trace the money in its progress through the whole commonwealth; where we shall find, that it must first quicken the diligence of every individual, before* **it encreases the price of labour**.
1. In other words, Hume is here describing the effect of a revolution in the value of the precious metals, namely, a depreciation, or, which is the same thing, a revolution in the *measure of value* of the precious metals. 
1. He correctly ascertains that, in the slow process of readjusting the prices of commodities, this depreciation 'increases the price of labour'--*vulgo*, wages–only in the last instance; 
	* that is to say, it increases the profit made by merchants and industrialists at the cost of the labourer (which he, however, thinks is just as it should be), and thus 'quickens diligence'. 
1. But he does not set himself the task of answering the real scientific question, namely, whether and in what way an increase in the supply of the precious metals, their value remaining the same, affects the prices of commodities; and he lumps together every 'increase of the precious metals' with their depreciation. 
1. Hume therefore does precisely what Marx says he does (*Zur Kritik*, p. 141). 
1. We shall come back once more to this point in passing, but we must first turn to Hume's essay on Interest. 
1. Hume's arguments, expressly directed against Locke that the rate of interest is not regulated by the amount of available money but by the rate of profit, and his other explanations of the causes which determine rises or falls in the rate of interest, are all to be found...
1. ...much more exactly though less cleverly stated, in *An Essay on the Governing Causes of the Natural Rate of Interest; wherein the sentiments of Sir W. Petty and Mr. Locke, on that head, are considered*. 
1. This work appeared in 1750, two years before Hume's essay; its author was J. Massie, a writer active in various fields, who had a wide public, as can be seen from contemporary English literature. 
1. Adam Smith's discussion of the rate of interest is closer to Massie than to Hume. 
1. Neither Massie nor Hume know or say anything regarding the nature of 'profit', which plays a role with both.

***

1. 'In general, [Herr Dühring sermonises us] the attitude of most of Hume’s commentators has been very prejudiced, and ideas have been attributed to him which he never entertained in the least'. 
1. And Herr Dühring himself gives us more than one striking example of this 'attitude'. 
1. For example, Hume’s essay on interest begins with the following words:
	* *'Nothing is esteemed a more certain sign of the flourishing condition of any nation than the lowness of interest:* 
	* *'And with reason; though I believe the cause is somewhat different from what is commonly apprehended.'*
1. In the very first sentence, therefore, Hume cites the view that the lowness of interest is the surest indication of the flourishing condition of a nation as a commonplace which had already become trivial in his day. 
1. And in fact this 'idea' had already had fully a hundred years, since Child, to become generally current. 
1. But we are told:
	* 'Among [Hume's] views on the rate of interest *we must particularly draw attention to the idea* that it is the true barometer of conditions [conditions of what?] and that its lowness is an almost infallible sign of the prosperity of a nation.' (p. 130)

***

1. Who is the 'prejudiced' and captivated 'commentator' who says this? 
1. None other than Herr Dühring!
1. What arouses the naive astonishment of our critical historian is the fact that Hume, in connection with some felicitous idea or other, 'does not even claim to have originated it'. 
1. This would certainly not have happened to Herr Dühring. 
1. We have seen how Hume confuses every increase of the precious metals with such an increase as is accompanied by a depreciation, a revolution in their own value, hence, in the *measure of value* of commodities. 
1. This confusion was inevitable with Hume because he had not the slightest understanding of the function of the precious metals as the measure of value. 
1. And he could not have it, because he had absolutely no knowledge of value itself. 
1. The word itself is to be found perhaps only once in his essays, namely, in the passage where, in attempting to 'correct' Locke's erroneous notion that the precious metals had 'only an imaginary value', he makes it even worse by saying that they had 'merely a fictitious value'. 
1. In this he is much inferior not only to Petty but to many of his English contemporaries. 
1. He shows the same 'backwardness' in still proclaiming the old-fashioned notion that the 'merchant' is the mainspring of production--an idea which Petty had long passed beyond. 
1. As for Herr Dühring’s assurance that in his essays Hume concerned himself with the 'chief economic relationships', if the reader only compares Cantillon’s work quoted by Adam Smith (which appeared the same year as Hume's essays, 1752, but many years after its author’s death), he will be surprised at the narrow range of Hume’s economic writings. 
1. Hume, as we have said, in spite of the letters- patent issued to him by Herr Dühring, is nevertheless quite a respectable figure also in the field of political economy, but in this field he is anything but an original investigator, and even less an epoch-making one.

1. The influence of his economic essays on the educated circles of his day was due not merely to his excellent presentation, but principally to the fact that the essays were a progressive and optimistic glorification of industry and trade, which were then flourishing--
1. --in other words, of the capitalist society which at that time was rapidly rising in England, and whose 'approval' they therefore had to gain. 
1. Let one instance suffice here. 
1. Everyone knows the passionate fight that the masses of the English people were waging, just in Hume’s day, against the system of indirect taxes which was being regularly exploited by the notorious Sir Robert Walpole for the relief of the landlords and of the rich in general. 
1. In his essay *Of Taxes*, in which, without mentioning his name, Hume polemises against his indispensable authority Vanderlint--the stoutest opponent of indirect taxation and the most determined advocate of a land tax–we read:
	* *'They [taxes on consumption] must be very heavy taxes, indeed, and very injudiciously levied, which the artisan will not, of himself, be enabled to pay, by superior industry and frugality,* without raising the price of his labour.'
1. It is almost as if Robert Walpole himself were speaking, especially if we also take into consideration the passage in the essay on 'public credit' in which, referring to the difficulty of taxing the state’s creditors, the following is said:
	* 'The diminution of their revenue would not be *disguised* under the appearance of a branch of excise or customs.'
1. As might have been expected of a Scotchman, Hume’s admiration of bourgeois acquisitiveness was by no means purely platonic. 
1. Starting as a poor man, he worked himself up to a very substantial annual income of many thousands of pounds; which Herr Dühring (as he is here not dealing with Petty) tactfully expresses in this way:
	* *Possessed of very small means to start with he succeeded, **by good domestic economy**, in reaching the position of not having to write to please anyone.*
1. Herr Dühring further says:
	* *'He had never made the slightest concession to the influence of parties, princes or universities.'*
1. There is no evidence that Hume ever entered into a literary partnership with a 'Wagener', but it is well known that he was an indefatigable partisan of the Whig oligarchy, which thought highly of '*Church* and state', and that in reward for these services he was given first a secretaryship in the Embassy in Paris and subsequently the incomparably more important and better-paid post of an Under-Secretary of State.

1. *'In politics Hume was and always remained conservative and strongly monarchist in his views. For this reason he was never so bitterly denounced for heresy as Gibbon by the supporters of the established church,'* says old Schlosser.
1. *'This selfish Hume, this lying historian* [reproaches the English monks with being fat, having neither wife nor family and living by begging;] *but he himself never had a family or a wife, and was a great, fat fellow, fed, in considerable part, out of public money, without having merited it by any real public services'*--this is what the 'rude' plebeian Cobbett says.
1. Hume was 'in essential respects greatly superior to a Kant in the **practical** management of life', is what Herr Dühring says.
1. But why is Hume given such an exaggerated position in *Kritische Geschichte*? 
1. Simply because this 'serious and subtle thinker' has the honour of enacting the Dühring of the eighteenth century. 
1. Hume serves as proof that 'the creation of this whole branch of science [economics] is the achievement of a more enlightened philosophy';
1. And similarly Hume as predecessor is the best guarantee that this whole branch of science will find its close, for the immediately foreseeable future, in that phenomenal man who has transformed the merely 'more enlightened' philosophy into the absolutely luminous philosophy of reality, and with whom, just as was the case with Hume, 
	* *'the cultivation of philosophy in the narrow sense of the word is combined--something unprecedented on German soil--with scientific endeavours on behalf of the national economy.'*
1. Accordingly we find Hume, in any case respectable as an economist, inflated into an economic star of the first magnitude, whose importance has hitherto been denied only by the same envious people who have hitherto also so obstinately hushed up Herr Dühring's achievements, 'authoritative for the epoch'.

***

1. The *physiocratic* school left us in *Quesnay’s Tableau économique*, as everyone knows, a nut on which all former critics and historians of political economy have up to now broken their jaws in vain; 
1. This *Tableau*, which was intended to bring out clearly the physiocrats’ conception of the production and circulation of a country's total wealth, remained obscure enough for the succeeding generations of economists. 
1. On this subject, too, Herr Dühring comes to finally enlighten us.
