## The Origins of Marx's General Intellect

### Opening qutotations
* Marx (*Grundrisse*, 1858): "The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accodrance with it."

### The March of Intellect
1. 1828 Cartoon by William Heath in the series 'March of Intellect' depicts a giant automaton advancing with long strides and holding a broom to sweep away a dusty mass of clerks, clergy, and bureaucrats, representing figures of the old order and obsolete laws.
1. While at first the cartoon might seem a paean to democratic ideals and intellectual advance, on closer observation, the caricature is intended to ridicule the belief that the technologies of industrial automation (already resembling robots) might become a true agent of political change and social emancipation under the command of public education.
1. Indeed, Heath's series of satirical engravings was originally commissioned by the Tories to voice their sarcasm regarding a potential democratisation of knowledge and technology across all classes. 
1. Nonetheless, by dint of his visionary pen, they became an accidental manifesto for the progressive camp and the invention of the future.
1. The March of Intellect was a phrase introduced by Robert Owen in a letter to *The Times* in 1824. aka the 'March of Mind'. 
	* The campaign triggered a reactionary and unsurprisingly racist backlash: the *Times* started to mock the ambitions of the working class under sarcastic headlines of the worst colonial mentality such as 'The March of Intellect in Africa'.
1. In 1828 the *London Magazine* endorsed the March of Intellect for the benefit of the 'general intellect of the country'-- which...thanks to mass education, would understand the need to reform a decaying legislative system.
1. When in 1858 Marx used the expression (in English) 'general intellect' in the 'Fragment on Machines' of the *Grundrisse*, he was echoing the political climate of the March of Intellect and the power of 'general social knowledge' to...weaken and subvert the chains of capitalism rather than those of old institutions.
