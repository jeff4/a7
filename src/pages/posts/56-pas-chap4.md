## The Origins of Marx's General Intellect

### Opening quotations
* Marx (*Grundrisse*, 1858): "The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accodrance with it."

### The March of Intellect
1. 1828 Cartoon by William Heath in the series 'March of Intellect' depicts a giant automaton advancing with long strides and holding a broom to sweep away a dusty mass of clerks, clergy, and bureaucrats, representing figures of the old order and obsolete laws.
1. While at first the cartoon might seem a paean to democratic ideals and intellectual advance, on closer observation, the caricature is intended to ridicule the belief that the technologies of industrial automation (already resembling robots) might become a true agent of political change and social emancipation under the command of public education.
1. Indeed, Heath's series of satirical engravings was originally commissioned by the Tories to voice their sarcasm regarding a potential democratisation of knowledge and technology across all classes. 
1. Nonetheless, by dint of his visionary pen, they became an accidental manifesto for the progressive camp and the invention of the future.
1. The March of Intellect was a phrase introduced by Robert Owen in a letter to *The Times* in 1824. aka the 'March of Mind'. 
	* The campaign triggered a reactionary and unsurprisingly racist backlash: the *Times* started to mock the ambitions of the working class under sarcastic headlines of the worst colonial mentality such as 'The March of Intellect in Africa'.
1. In 1828 the *London Magazine* endorsed the March of Intellect for the benefit of the 'general intellect of the country'-- which...thanks to mass education, would understand the need to reform a decaying legislative system.
1. When in 1858 Marx used the expression (in English) 'general intellect' in the 'Fragment on Machines' of the *Grundrisse*, he was echoing the political climate of the March of Intellect and the power of 'general social knowledge' to...weaken and subvert the chains of capitalism rather than those of old institutions. 

### Historiography of Marx's *Grundrisse*

### Marx's interpretation of Babbage
1. Simon Schaffer (1994) finds that 'Babbage's most penetrating London reader was Marx'. Marx draws out two primary analytical principles from Babbage.
1. **Principle One**: the *labour theory of the machine* aka a machine or system of machines encodes within its construction the knowledge of a previous system of human-only labor. 
	* Aka, it can imitate and replace the group of workers for some set of tasks. 
	* This idea had earlier by formulated by Adam Smith, but was better articulated by Babbage due to the latter's greater direct mechanical experience
1. **Principle Two**: the *principle of labour calculation* aka **The Babbabge Principle**
	* The organization of a production into small tasks therefore allows a manager to calculate the exact necessary quantites of labour needed to be purchased for each small tasks
	* Aka, the *division of labour* allows for the *division of value to be purchased*.
	* In this respect, the division of labour provides not only the design of machinery but also an economic configuration to calibrate and calculate surplus labour extraction. 
	* In complex forms of management such as Taylorism, the principle of surplus labour modulation opens onto a clockwork view of labour, which can be further subdivided and recomposed into algorithmic assemblages. 
1. The synthesis of both analytical principles ideally describes the machine as an apparatus that actively projects back a new articulation and metrics of labour. In the pages of *Capital*, the industrial machine appears to be not just a regulator to discipline labour but also a calculator to measure relative surplus value, echoing the numerical exactitude of Babbage's calculating engines.
1. Taken together, Babbage's two principles show that the general intellect of the *Grundrisse* evolves in *Capital* into a machinic collective worker, almost with the features of a proto-cybernetic organism, and the industrial machine becomes a calculator of the relative surplus value that this cyborg produces.

### Next four sections go through Pasquinelli's analysis
1. Here, I will read the *Grundrisse* and *Capital* through the lens of Babbage's two analytical principles. We will see how Babbage's labour theory of the machine is used by Marx to raise the figure of the collective worker as a sort of reincarnation of the general intellect and, furthermore, how Babbage's principle of modulation of surplus labour is used to sketch the idea of relative surplus value. 
1. In discussing the relation between labour and machinery, knowledge and capital, Marx found himself embedded in a hybrid dialectics between German idealism and British political economy. The similar argumentation in the Grundrisse and Capital in the sections on machinery and division of labour follows four movements, to which I will now turn:
	1. the invention of machinery through the division of labour
	1. the alienation of knowledge by machinery 
	1. the devaluation of capital by knowledge accumulation 
	1. the rise of the collective worker


#### the invention of machinery through the division of labour

#### the alienation of knowledge by machinery 

#### the devaluation of capital by knowledge accumulation 

#### the rise of the collective worker

### The machine is a social relation, not a thing
1. Harry Braverman (1974) was probably the first 20th-century Marxist to rediscover Babbage's pioneering experiments in computation and influence on Marx's theory of the division of labour.
1. While Marx read Thompson, Hodgskin, and Babbage, he never employed the notion of mental labour, probably in order to avoid supporting a labour aristocracy of skilled artisans as a political subject separate from the working class.
1. For Marx, labour is always collective: there is no individual labour that is more prestigious than others, and, therefore, mental labour is always general; the mind is by definition social. 
	* Rather than a *knowledge theory of labour* that grants primacy to conscious activity, like the one in Thompson and Hodgskin, Marx maintains a *labour theory of knowledge* that recognises the cognitive import of forms of labour that are social, distributed, spontaneous, and unconscious. 
	* Intelligence emerges from the abstract assemblage of workers' simple gestures and microdecisions, even and especially those which are unconscious.
	* In the general intellect studies and the history of technology, these are the in-between worlds of collective intelligence and unconscious cooperation, but also those of 'mechanised knowledge' and 'mindful mechanics'.
	* It ends up being Babbage who provides Marx with an operative paradigm to overcome Hegel's *Geist* and imbricate knowledge, science, and the general intellect into production.
1. As already stressed, the distinction between manual and mental labour disappears in Marxism because, from the abstract point of view of capital, all waged labour, without distinction, produces surplus value; all labour is abstract labour. However, the abstract eye of capital that regulates the labour theory of value employs a specific instrument to measure labour: the clock. In this way, what looks like a universal law has to deal with the metrics of a very mundane technology; after all, clocks are not universal.
1. Machines can impose a metrics of labour other than time, as has recently happened with social data analytics. As much as new instruments define new domains of science, likewise they define new domains of labour after being invented by labour itself.
1. Any new machine is a new configuration of space, time, and social relations, and it projects new metrics of such diagrams.
1. In the Victorian age, a metrology of mental labour existed only in an embryonic state. A rudimentary econometrics of knowledge begins to emerge only in the twentieth century with the first theory of information.

### Conclusion
1. The thesis of this chapter is that Marx's labour theory of value did not resolve the metrics for the domains of knowledge and intelligence, which had to be explored in the articulation of the machine design and in the Babbage principle.
1. Following Braverman and Schaffer, one could add that Babbage provided not just a labour theory of the machine but a *labour theory of machine intelligence*.
1. Indeed, Babbage's calculating engines ('intelligent machines' of their age) were an implementation of the analytical eye of the factory's master.
1. Cousins of Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, they were instruments, simultaneously, of surveillance and measurement of labour. It is this idea that we should consider and apply to the age of artificial intelligence and its political critique, although reversing its polarisation, in order to declare computing infrastructures a concretion of labour in common.
