	1. [What is a Med Spa?](https://medspa.com/what-is-a-med-spa)
	1. [Why do i need a med spa?](https://medspa.com/why-do-i-need-a-medspa)
* General principle: any time a scalpel or needle is used, it's considered a medical treatment. 

### From What is a Med Spa article

1. **Q: 'What constitutes a medical treatment?'**
	* "most states believe that any treatment that affects anything outside the dead skin cells, i.e. the epidermis, is considered to be a medical treatment. There is some confusion about whether certain treatments constitute medical treatments, such as microneedling and dermaplaning."
	* Also, AmSpa encourages consumers to be aware that oftentimes noncompliant medical spas will indicate that medical spa treatments are not medical treatments, when they are in fact considered medical treatments by the state. Body sculpting and laser treatments are often considered medical treatments, for instance, even though they are often advertised as non-medical treatments. It’s in your hands to do the proper research. There are medical spas out there that aren’t necessarily always honest or even aware about compliance and legalities. **The laws are changing and difficult to find, therefore it’s incumbent upon all of us to be aware of the legalities of the industry.**
1. **Q: An aesthetician wnats to perform my Botox injection. Should I let her?**
	* No. Botox is considered a medical treatment, therefore, prior to your initial treatment, the medical spa should offer you an in-person exam by either a doctor, a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant. While each state treats each procedure differently, AmSpa recommends that only an RN or higher-level practitioner perform Botox or injectables.
1. **Q: The medical spa I go to has a nurse practitioner on site, but no doctor. Is this legal? Is this safe?**
	* It depends on your state, but as a general rule, yes, that’s perfectly fine. Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants are called “mid-level” providers. This means that they can do many of the same things that a doctor can do provided they are properly trained and experienced. They can see new patients, make diagnoses, develop treatment plans, and even prescribe medication. Most states do not require the doctor overseeing the NP or PA to be on site, although there are often distance and documentation requirements. As long as the NP or PA is properly trained and experienced, there should be no problem with the spa being staffed by an NP or PA. But don’t be shy! Ask about the NP’s experience, ask about his or her overseeing doctor, and ask to see all supporting documentation if you have questions. All of this should be readily available and, if it’s not, that’s a red flag you need to take into consideration.

* Saw this HN homepage -- ['Ribbon Health (YC S17) is hiring a Sales Engineering Director for Enterprises'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40727427) Ribbon Health's platform has two basic use cases: (1) Helping patients find doctors through referrals. They have a database of every provider in the US. *and* (2) Provider data Management - act as single source of truth to integrate custom insurance data with provider datasets.
	* Platform "transforms provider data from operational headache to a source of business efficiency and value."
	* Ribbon Directory: 'The industry’s most comprehensive and accurate data asset on healthcare providers and facilities, from basics like address and insurance network, to detailed metrics like common procedures, affiliations, cost, quality, and more. Data is constantly compiled and refreshed from thousands of sources, and Ribbon AI models surface the most accurate data.'
* From TC today [How Abridge became one of the most talked about healthcare AI startups](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/how-abridge-became-one-of-the-most-talked-about-healthcare-ai-startups/)
	* 'Ask any of the health-focused VCs to name one of the top AI startups and one name comes up over and over again: a company  based in Pittsburgh called Abridge.'
	* Its a medical scribe company
	* Founder: Dr. Shiv Rao, practicing cardiologist and part-time corporate VC at UPitt Medical Center.
	* 'Although most corporations are still very cautious about adopting AI tools, large medical systems are eager to sign contracts with Abridge.'
	* '“The sales cycle for [health systems] can be 18 to 24 months,” said Rao. “When we started the company, we knew what we were in for.”  But with a four-year lead on a virtual scribe product trained on thousands of doctor-patient conversations, and now that AI is booming, hospitals are suddenly buying Abridge at a rapid pace, a stark contrast to their typically protracted purchasing behavior. The company has announced a new health system customer nearly every week since the start of 2024.'
	* 'Large hospitals are not only buying multi-thousand seat licenses of Abridge but, in many cases, publishing glowing reviews about how the health tech’s software is changing physicians’ lives. Hospital executives and doctors are describing Abridge as “life-changing,” “magical,” and “one of the most important paradigm shifts within our careers.”'
	* Press releases from [Christus Health based in Texas](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/christus-health-announcement), [MemorialCare](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/christus-health-announcement), [University of Chicago Medicine](https://www.abridge.com/press-release/abridge-uchicago)
* Is it really true that the big budgets that come big hospitals to buy who already use Epic EHR and demand integrations...is this worth the tradeoff in the long slow certification process? Is there a niche possible for smaller systems or PGPs that might be more amenable to PLG that does not rely on partnership/channel/integration with Epic?

### BioRender

Research from Crunchbase
* 23 open positions from their Lever /jobs page

### Notes from 2021 Visualize 2021
* CEO and cofounder Shiz Aoki
* Started in 2009 as a medical illustrator 
* Loved being in the wetlab and OR, figuring out how to visualize the latest techniques, figures, etc. for teaching.
* Started working at NatGeo. Realized that visuals could teach in any demographic.
* Effective visual communication enales us to captivate audiences with all levels of knowledge
* Started her own studio to work with amazing images.
* Still so few medical illustrations.
* demand for medical illustration is still super high. only 30 graduate overall in the entire world every year
* Challenges starting at 4:40
    * Super-painstaking and takes a long time to draw, using PPT or Adobe Illustrator
    * No consistent visual standard. e.g, a spiky ball might represent an antigen-presenting cell; somtimes it represents a cancer cell
    * So huge cognitive load. Not just for creator producing images, but also for audience consuming them.
* Started on journey with Katia Shteyn and Ryan Marien
    * CTO Katia former engineer at Dropbox and Google


I am thrilled (read: over the moon) to share that I've joined the immensely talented team at BioRender to lead User Acquisitions and Revenue marketing! 

BioRender has created an incredible, delightful product with a world class NPS and a community of 1.5 million scientists in more than 200 countries. 

👉 Five years in, the company is profitable and growing revenue at 150%+ year/year powered by customer love.

👉 Winning Great Place to Work 2020, 2021, & 2022, the company culture demonstrated thus far has been deeply respectful, inclusive and warm. I've been blown away by the level of both ambition and humility in everyone I've met so far. 

👉 Ranked #17 among Canada's Top Growing companies (https://lnkd.in/gwhErSFU) 

👉 BioRender ranked #3 in Deloitte's 50 fastest growing companies in Canada, and #22/500 in North America

👉 Recognized as a top-40 rising PLG company by OpenView (https://lnkd.in/gbJzA4rn) 🙌

Greg Head, recently wrote a post on getting new customers and scaling efficiently as bigger challenges than building a great product for 90% of software companies. "Poor distribution — not product — is the number one cause of failure," said Peter Thiel.

But most importantly, as our CEO Shiz Aoki put it, "We're honored for this ranking, but our mission has never been growth for growth's sake.. we've always led with our mission first - to accelerate the world's ability to discover, learn and communicate science... through thoughtful and sustainable growth." 

Inspired to contribute in solving sustainable growth for a company with an incredible mission.

Super grateful to Tom Berger and Ryan Marien for the opportunity and excited to join this team of talented folks - @cindy liu, Piper Stull-Lane, Lauren Lochtefeld, Nick Heim 🧬 , Tammy - you all inspire me! ❤️ 

Big shout out to the recruiting team Sarah Damon, Rose Garvey and Alexander Pucci for supporting me through the process! 🙏
