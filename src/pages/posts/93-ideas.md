### Notes from 2021 Visualize 2021
* CEO and cofounder Shiz Aoki
* Started in 2009 as a medical illustrator 
* Loved being in the wetlab and OR, figuring out how to visualize the latest techniques, figures, etc. for teaching.
* Started working at NatGeo. Realized that visuals could teach in any demographic.
* Effective visual communication enales us to captivate audiences with all levels of knowledge
* Started her own studio to work with amazing images.
* Still so few medical illustrations.
* demand for medical illustration is still super high. only 30 graduate overall in the entire world every year
* Challenges starting at 4:40
    * Super-painstaking and takes a long time to draw, using PPT or Adobe Illustrator
    * No consistent visual standard. e.g, a spiky ball might represent an antigen-presenting cell; somtimes it represents a cancer cell
    * So huge cognitive load. Not just for creator producing images, but also for audience consuming them.
* Started on journey with Katia Shteyn and Ryan Marien
    * CTO Katia former engineer at Dropbox and Google


I am thrilled (read: over the moon) to share that I've joined the immensely talented team at BioRender to lead User Acquisitions and Revenue marketing! 

BioRender has created an incredible, delightful product with a world class NPS and a community of 1.5 million scientists in more than 200 countries. 

üëâ Five years in, the company is profitable and growing revenue at 150%+ year/year powered by customer love.

üëâ Winning Great Place to Work 2020, 2021, & 2022, the company culture demonstrated thus far has been deeply respectful, inclusive and warm. I've been blown away by the level of both ambition and humility in everyone I've met so far. 

üëâ Ranked #17 among Canada's Top Growing companies (https://lnkd.in/gwhErSFU) 

üëâ BioRender ranked #3 in Deloitte's 50 fastest growing companies in Canada, and #22/500 in North America

üëâ Recognized as a top-40 rising PLG company by OpenView (https://lnkd.in/gbJzA4rn) üôå

Greg Head, recently wrote a post on getting new customers and scaling efficiently as bigger challenges than building a great product for 90% of software companies. "Poor distribution ‚Äî not product ‚Äî is the number one cause of failure," said Peter Thiel.

But most importantly, as our CEO Shiz Aoki put it, "We're honored for this ranking, but our mission has never been growth for growth's sake.. we've always led with our mission first - to accelerate the world's ability to discover, learn and communicate science... through thoughtful and sustainable growth." 

Inspired to contribute in solving sustainable growth for a company with an incredible mission.

Super grateful to Tom Berger and Ryan Marien for the opportunity and excited to join this team of talented folks - @cindy liu, Piper Stull-Lane, Lauren Lochtefeld, Nick Heim üß¨ , Tammy - you all inspire me! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Big shout out to the recruiting team Sarah Damon, Rose Garvey and Alexander Pucci for supporting me through the process! üôè 

Below is the heartwarming welcome I received from the interviewing team, moments after I accepted the offer on September 18 - what a welcome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
