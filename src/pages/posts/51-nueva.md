### Timeline -- mostly by JH with some adaptation from hacker noon
* See [main ai timeline page](/posts/65-ai-timeline/) 
* See also [general timeline](/posts/66-tech-timeline/) for more milestones in tech history.

***

### Main
* Kuhn, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*
* History of computing link by Steve Furber, one of the early ARM chip designers. Published March 2017. ['Microprocessors: the engines of the digital age.'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5378251/)
    * JH notes [here](/posts/64-microproc/)
* [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38739832) about [this substack piece](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/god-is-dead-so-they-are-building) referencing Sutton, Schmidhuber, and Sam Altman.

### Axes
* Individual vs. Structural Forces
	* What if Lenin had died earlier?
	* What if Martin Luther had died earlier?
* Contingency vs. Determinism
	* Technology determinism
* Continuity vs. Change
* Lumping vs. Splitting
* Forces: Political, Social, Economic, Cultural, Intellectual


***
## 'Top-Down Symbolic' vs. 'Bottom-Up Connectionist'
### Symbolic
* Logical
* By rules
* Human-encoded
* Dartmouth AI approach McCarthy
* Based on philosophy
### Connectionist
* Statistical
* By experience
* “Learned from experience”
* Hayek / McCulloch + Pitts / Rosenblatt
* Based on experiment

### Brief notes on Pasquinelli

#### Chapter 4
* 19th century. Babbage and Marx. Two principles
	1. A machine or a system of machines can replicate the work of a worker or group of workers
	1. **The Babbage Principle** whereby the division of labour means there is a division to units of work that can be measured, optimized, etc. Leads to Taylorism and Fordist production.

#### Chapter 9 - Invention of the Perceptron

### 12/27/2023 Will Scaling Work by Dwarmish
* 12/27/2023 - [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38781484) on Dwarkesh Patel's Substack article ['Will Scaling Work?'](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/will-scaling-work). 
* Debate between 2 characters: Believer and Skeptic
####  Question 1: Will We Run out of Data?

####  Question 2: Has Scaling Ever Actually Worked So Far?

####  Question 3: Do Models Understand the World?

####  Conclusion

### Thoughts on Doug Engelbart
* From Adam Fisher *Valley of Genius: The Uncensored History of Silicon Valley* (2018)
* Chapter 1: The Big Bang--Everything Starts with Doug Engelbart
* Dramatis Personae
	* [Bill English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_English_(computer_engineer)) who worked with Engelbart in making the first computer mouse at SRI. Later worked at Xerox PARC and Sun Microsystems. He was extremely important in building and executing the mother of demos in SF in December 1968.
	* [Bob Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)) who first approved Engelbart's proposal from SRI in tne early 1960s
	* [J.C.R. Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider) who headed the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at [ARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA)
	* [Bill Paxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton_(computer_scientist)) worked with Engelbart on the NLS. Later co-founded Adobe in the early 1980s, retired from Adobe in 1990, and then taught at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UCSB. See more [here](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/paxton) and [here](https://news.ucsb.edu/2021/020203/accidental-astrophysicist).
* The [NLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)) aka 'oN-Line System' was implemented on a [SDS 940 Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDS_940)
* ARPA said cost is no object, make sure it's redundant. They ended up spending $175k in 1968 dollars which is about $1.5million in 2023.
