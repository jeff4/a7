### Notes
* History of computing link by Steve Furber, one of the early ARM chip designers. Published March 2017. ['Microprocessors: the engines of the digital age.'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5378251/)
* Quick history of 1944 neural networks proposed, early researchers moved to MIT in 1952, Minsky and Papert topped it 1968 etc in this [Intro to Liquid Neural Networks](https://hackernoon.com/an-introduction-to-liquid-neural-networks-nt5c33t7)
