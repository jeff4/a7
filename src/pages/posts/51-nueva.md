### 12/27/2023 Hacker Noon / Liquid NN article
* [Quick history](https://hackernoon.com/an-introduction-to-liquid-neural-networks-nt5c33t7) from 1944 - 1968. With some additional notes by Jeff.
* Timeline:
	* **1944** - Perceptron (aka the *McCulloch-Pitts neuron*) with zero layers proposed as pure mathematical expression by [Warren S. McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch) and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts). Paper was "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943). 
		* Fascinating history of Walter Pitts as a 15-yr-old runaway who impressed Betrand Russell at the age of 12. Died tragically young in 1969 at the age f 46.
		* Norber Weiner was a weird dude and had a massive falling out with both McCulloch and Pitts and cut them all off.
		* Liquid ANN article references 2017 [MIT article](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414?ref=hackernoon.com#:~:text=Neural%20networks%20were%20first%20proposed,the%20first%20cognitive%20science%20department.) that has subtitle *Ballyhooed artificial-intelligence technique known as “deep learning” revives 70-year-old idea.* 
	* **1948** - [Donald Hebb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O._Hebb) proposes Hebbian Learning in *The Organization of Behavior*.  
	* **1952** - McCulloch and Pitts did this work at University of Chicago during and after the war. They moved to MIT in 1952.
	* **1956** - Dartmouth Conference with John McCarthy
	* **1957** - [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt), alum of Bronx Science, Cornell undergrad, Cornell PhD, builds the mechanical [first implementation of the perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron#Mark_I_Perceptron_machine) at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, funded by US Office of Naval Research and the Rome Air Developmwent Center.
		* See also this history at the [Cornell website](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/09/professors-perceptron-paved-way-ai-60-years-too-soon)
	* **1969** - MIT mathematicians Minsky and Papert's critique of Perceptron

### 12/27/2023 Will Scaling Work by Dwarmish
* 12/27/2023 - [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38781484) on Dwarkesh Patel's Substack article ['Will Scaling Work?'](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/will-scaling-work). 
* Debate between 2 characters: Believer and Skeptic
####  Question 1: Will We Run out of Data?

####  Question 2: Has Scaling Ever Actually Worked So Far?

####  Question 3: Do Models Understand the World?

####  Conclusion
