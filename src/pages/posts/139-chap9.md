## Part II / Chapter 9 / Natural Laws of the Economy, Rent of Land

1. Up to this point we have been unable, despite our sincerest efforts, to discover how Herr Dühring, in the domain of economics, can 'come forward with the claim to a new system which is not merely adequate for the epoch but authoritative for the epoch'.
1. However, what we have not been able to discern in his theory of force and his doctrine of value and of capital, may perhaps become as clear as daylight to us when we consider the 'natural laws of national economy' put forward by Herr Dühring. 
1. For, as he puts it with his usual originality and in his trenchant way, 
	* *'the triumph of the higher scientific method consists in passing beyond the mere description and classification of apparently static matter and attaining living intuitions which illumine the genesis of things.* 
	* *'Knowledge of laws is therefore the most perfect knowledge, for it shows us how one process is conditioned by another.'*
1. The very first natural law of any economy has been specially discovered by Herr Dühring. 
1. Adam Smith, 'curiously enough, not only did not bring out the leading part played by the most important factor in all economic development, but even completely failed to give it distinctive formulation, and thus unintentionally reduced to a subordinate role the power which placed its stamp on the development of modern Europe'.
1. This 'fundamental law, to which the leading role must be assigned, is that of the technical equipment, one might even say armament, of the natural economic energy of man'.
1. This 'fundamental law' discovered by Herr Dühring reads as follows:

### Law Number 1

1. 'The productivity of the economic instruments, natural resources and human energy is increased by inventions anddiscoveries.'
1. We are overcome with astonishment. 
1. Herr Dühring treats us as Molière's newly baked nobleman is treated by the wag who announces to him the news that all through his life he has been speaking prose without knowing it. 
1. That in a good many cases the productive power of labour is increased by inventions and discoveries... 
	* (but also that in very many cases it is not increased, as is proved by the mass of waste-paper in the archives of every patent office in the world) we knew long ago; 
	* but we owe to Herr Dühring the enlightening information that this banality, which is as old as the hills, is the fundamental law of all economics.
1. If 'the triumph of the higher scientific method' in economics, as in philosophy, consists only in giving a high-sounding name to the first commonplace that comes to one’s mind, and trumpeting it forth as a natural law or even a fundamental law, then it becomes possible for anybody, even the editors of the Berlin Volks-Zeitung, to lay 'deeper foundations' and to revolutionise science. 
1. We should then 'in all rigour' be forced to apply to Herr Dühring himself Herr Dühring's judgment on Plato:
	* *If however that is supposed to be political-economic wisdom, then the author of the critical foundations shares it with every person who ever had occasion to conceive an idea or even only to babble about anything that was obvious on the face of it.*
1. If, for example, we say animals eat, we are saying quite calmly, in our innocence, something of great import; 
	* for we only have to say that eating is the fundamental law of all animal life, and we have revolutionised the whole of zoology.

### Law Number 2 Division of Labour
1. Division of Labour: 'The cleaving of trades and the dissection of activities raises the productivity of labour.'
1. In so far as this is true, it also has been a commonplace since Adam Smith. *How* far it is true will be shown in Part III.

### Law Number 3
* *Distance and transport* are the chief causes which hinder or facilitate the cooperation of the productive forces.

### Law Number 4
* The industrial state has an incomprabably greater population capacity than the agricultural state.

### Law Number 5
* In the economy, nothing takes place without a material interest.

### Engels' Commentary
1. These are the 'natural laws' on which Herr Dühring founds his new economics. 
1. He remains faithful to his method, already demonstrated in the section on Philosophy. 
1. In economics too a few self-evident statements of the utmost banality--moreover quite often very ineptly expressed--form the axioms which need no proof, the fundamental theorems, the natural laws. 
1. Under the pretext of developing the content of these laws, which have no content, he seizes the opportunity to pour out a wordy stream of economic twaddle on the various themes whose names occur in these pretended laws--
	* --inventions, division of labour, means of transport, population, interests, competition, and so forth--
	* --a verbal outpouring whose flat commonplaces are seasoned only with oracular grandiloquence, and here and there with inept formulations or pretentious hair-splitting over all kinds of casuistical subtleties. 
1. Then finally we reach rent of land, earnings of capital, and wages, and as we have dealt with only the two latter forms of appropriation in the preceding exposition, we propose now in conclusion to make a brief examination of the Dühringian conception of rent.  
1. In doing this we shall not consider those points which Herr Dühring has merely copied from his predecessor Carey; we are not concerned with Carey, nor with defending Ricardo's views on rent of land against Carey’s distortions and stupidities. 
1. We are only concerned with Herr Dühring, and he defines rent as 'that income which the proprietor *as such* draws from the land'.

***

1. The economic concept of rent of land, which is what Herr Dühring is to explain, is straightaway transferred by him into the juridical sphere, so that we are no wiser than we were before.
