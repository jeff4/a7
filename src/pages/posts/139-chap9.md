## Part II / Chapter 9 / Natural Laws of the Economy, Rent of Land

1. Up to this point we have been unable, despite our sincerest efforts, to discover how Herr Dühring, in the domain of economics, can 'come forward with the claim to a new system which is not merely adequate for the epoch but authoritative for the epoch'.
1. However, what we have not been able to discern in his theory of force and his doctrine of value and of capital, may perhaps become as clear as daylight to us when we consider the 'natural laws of national economy' put forward by Herr Dühring. 
1. For, as he puts it with his usual originality and in his trenchant way, 
	* *'the triumph of the higher scientific method consists in passing beyond the mere description and classification of apparently static matter and attaining living intuitions which illumine the genesis of things.* 
	* *'Knowledge of laws is therefore the most perfect knowledge, for it shows us how one process is conditioned by another.'*
1. The very first natural law of any economy has been specially discovered by Herr Dühring. 
1. Adam Smith, 'curiously enough, not only did not bring out the leading part played by the most important factor in all economic development, but even completely failed to give it distinctive formulation, and thus unintentionally reduced to a subordinate role the power which placed its stamp on the development of modern Europe'.
1. This 'fundamental law, to which the leading role must be assigned, is that of the technical equipment, one might even say armament, of the natural economic energy of man'.
1. This 'fundamental law' discovered by Herr Dühring reads as follows:

***
Law No. 1. “The productivity of the economic instruments, natural resources and human
energy is increased by inventions anddiscoveries” {65}.
We are overcome with astonishment. Herr Dühring treats us as Molière's newly baked nobleman is treated by the wag who announces to him the news that all through his life he has been speaking prose without knowing it. That in a good many cases the productive power of labour is increased by inventions and discoveries (but also that in very many cases it is not increased, as is proved by the mass of waste-paper in the archives of every patent office in the world) we knew long ago; but we owe to Herr Dühring the enlightening information that this banality, which is as old as the hills, is the fundamental law of all economics.
