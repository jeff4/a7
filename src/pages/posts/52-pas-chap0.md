## AI as Division of Labour
### Quotes
1. Karl Marx *Capital* (1867): "The special skill of each individual machine-operator, who has now been deprived of all significance, vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity in the face of the science, the gigantic natural forces, and the mass of the social labour embodied in the system of machinery, which, together with these three forces, constitutes the power of the 'master'."

1. Gramsci (1932): "All human beings are intellectuals ... although one can speak of intellectuals, one cannot speak of non-intellectuals, because non-intellectuals do not exist ... There is no human activity from which every form of intellectual participation can be excluded: *Homo faber* cannot be separated from *homo sapiens*."

1. In the twentieth century, few would have ever defined a truck driver as a 'cognitive worker', an intellectual. 
1. In the early twenty-first, however, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in self-driving vehicles, among other artefacts, has changed the perception of manual skills such as driving, revealing how the most valuable component of work in general has never been just manual, but has always been cognitive and cooperative as well. 
1. Thanks to AI research -- we must acknowledge it -- truck drivers have reached the pantheon of intelligentsia. 
1. It is a paradox -- a bitter political revelation -- that the most zealous development of automation has shown how much 'intelligence' is expressed by activities and jobs that are usually deemed manual and unskilled, an aspect that has often been neglected by labour organisation as much as critical theory. 
1. In fact, in the current digital age, only a few sociologists, such as Richard Sennett, have taken the trouble to emphasise that 'making is thinking', a dimension that the historians of science such as Lissa Roberts and Simon Schaffer have captured in the elegant image of the 'mindful hand' -- a hand that, in the workshop of the Renaissance as much as in those of the industrial age, has not only expressed muscular strength but also inspired design, inventions, and scientific breakthroughs. If there is a denial of the intelligence of manual labour and social activities today, that seems to be a symptom also of the overgrowth of the digital sphere and the dematerialisation of human activities, which have contributed to the aura of mystery that has been eventually constructed around AI.  
1. What is AI? A dominant view describes it as the quest 'to solve intelligence' -- a solution supposedly to be found in the secret logic of the mind or in the deep physiology of the brain, such as in its complex neural networks. 
1. In this book I argue, to the contrary, that the inner code of AI is constituted not by the imitation of biological intelligence but by the *intelligence of labour and social relations*. 
1. Today, it should be evident that AI is a project to capture the knowledge expressed through individual and collective behaviours and encode it into algorithmic models to automate the most diverse tasks: from image recognition and object manipulation to language translation and decision-making. 
1. As in a typical effect of ideology, the 'solution' to the enigma of AI is in front of our eyes, but nobody can see it -- nor does anybody want to.
1. Let us return to the contested project of the self-driving car. What kind of work does a driver perform? 
1. And to what extent can AI automate such an activity? 
1. With a considerable degree of approximation and hazard, a self- driving vehicle is designed to imitate all the micro-decisions that a driver makes on a busy road. 
1. Its artificial neural networks 'learn' the correlations between the visual perception of the environment and the mechanical control of the vehicle (steering, accelerating, braking) together with ethical decisions to be taken in a few milliseconds in case of danger. 
1. Driving requires high cognitive skills that cannot be left to improvisation, but also rapid problem-solving that is possible only thanks to habit and training that are not completely conscious. 
1. Driving remains essentially a social and cooperative activity, which follows both codified rules (with legal constraints) and spontaneous ones, including a tacit cultural code which is different in each locality. 
1. It is deemed difficult to encode such a complex activity, and even the entrepreneur Elon Musk has admitted, after not a few fatal accidents of Tesla cars, that 'generalized self-driving is a hard problem'. 
1. In all its problematic aspects, however, the industrial project of self-driving vehicles has made clear that the task of driving is not merely 'mechanical'. 
1. If the skill of driving can be translated into an algorithmic model to begin with, it is because driving is a logical activity -- because, ultimately, *all labour is logic*.  
1. What, then, is the relationship between labour, rules, and automation, i.e., the invention of new technologies? 
1. This entanglement is the core problem of AI which this book seeks to explore. 
1. But this is not a completely new perspective for framing AI. 
1. The historian of science Lorraine Daston, for example, has already illustrated this problem in the great calculation projects of the Enlightenment that preceded automatic computation. 
1. In the late eighteenth century, in order to produce the lengthy logarithmic tables necessary for the modernisation of revolutionary France, the mathematician Gaspard de Prony had the idea to apply the industrial method of the division of labour (canonised by Adam Smith in *The Wealth of Nations*) to hand calculation. 
1. For this purpose, de Prony arranged a *social algorithm* -- a hierarchical organisation of three groups of clerks which divided the toil and each performed one part of the long calculation, eventually composing the final results. 
1. A few years later, in industrial England, Charles Babbage adopted the intuition of the division of labour as the internal principle of the Difference Engine, designing in this way the first prototype of the modern computer. 
1. Babbage, importantly, understood that the division of labour was not only a principle to design machines but also to compute the costs of production (what has been known since then as the 'Babbage principle').  
1. In the industrial age, the supervision of the division of labour used to be the task of the factory's master. 
1. The eye of the master, in workshops and also in camps and plantations, had long supervised and disciplined workers, drawing the plans of assembly lines as well as the shifts of forced labour. 
1. Before industrial machines were invented, urban sweatshops and colonial estates were already 'mechanical' in their regime of body discipline and visuality. 
1. As the philosopher Michel Foucault illustrated, the imposition of such disciplinary techniques -- based on the segmentation of time, space, and relations -- prepared the terrain for the capitalist regime of labour exploitation. 
1. In parallel, the rationalist view of the world helped to further describe the movement of the human body in detail and draft its mechanisation. 
1. Historian Sigfried Giedion detailed this process in his famous volume *Mechanisation Takes Command*. According to Giedion, mechanisation begins 'with the concept of Movement', then it replaces handicraft, and, finally, its full development is 'the assembly line, wherein the entire factory is consolidated into a synchronous organism'.
