### To do

* [Main Notes](/posts/96-1/)
* See a new day for general thoughts

### AI SDR companies
* **11x**
* **Artisan**
	* 4/09/2025 [TC article](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/) on $25M Series A raise, following $12m raise during/post September 2024 YC cohort.
* **Qualified**
	* Interestingly, last [TC article](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/qualified-raises-95m-to-help-salesforce-users-with-their-sales-pipeline-generation/) on Qualified was from April 2022, during their $95 Series C raise from Sapphire, former corporate VC arm of SAP.
	* [Series B](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/qualified-raises-51m-to-help-salesforce-users-improve-their-sales-and-marketing-conversations/) was led by Salesforce in May, 2021.
	* $12m [Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/qualified-series-a/) from August, 2020. Note that co-founders are former Salesforce themselves. 
	* See also notes from previous meeting taken.

### List from Claude

* **Drift** - They've evolved from conversational marketing to incorporate AI-powered sales development capabilities
* **Conversica** - One of the early pioneers in AI sales assistants that can engage prospects in human-like conversations
* **Exceed.ai** (acquired by Genesys) - Offers automated lead engagement and qualification
* **Outreach** with their Kaia AI assistant - Built into their broader sales engagement platform
* **Apollo.io**- Has integrated AI capabilities into their sales intelligence platform
* **ZoomInfo** with their InboxAI - Combines their data with AI for outreach. They also have a product called [ZoomInfo Copilot](https://www.zoominfo.com/copilot) 
	* From chatgpt: "While both products aim to enhance sales efficiency through AI-driven insights, they serve different functions within the sales process. InboxAI emphasizes data capture and CRM integration, whereas Copilot focuses on real-time conversational assistance. Currently, there is no publicly available information indicating a direct integration or relationship between InboxAI and Copilot within ZoomInfo's product offerings."
	* So InboxAI is a real product, result of 2019 acquisition of Seattle based [Komiko](https://www.zoominfo.com/newsroom/press-releases/zoominfo-launches-inboxai)
	* Link to the [ChatGPT answer](https://chatgpt.com/share/67f6f321-5090-8013-b38e-c5cc26841f88)
* **Lavender** - Focuses on email optimization using AI
* **Orum** - Specializes in AI-powered phone outreach
* **Saleswhale** (acquired by 6sense) - AI assistant for marketing and sales teams

### Docket AI
* AI Sales Engineer, quoted in Dec, 2024 ai sdr article below.
* From July, 2024 [TC article](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/25/zoominfo-alum-raises-15m-for-startup-that-builds-ai-sales-engineers/)
    * "Docket, just like Glean and Atlassian’s Rovo, acts as a search engine for structured and unstructured workplace data."


### Notes from Dec 2024 article
* Actually, article originally published in August 2024, but republished in Dec 2024 with Tomazs' comments as an update.
* [TC article](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/ai-sdr-startups-are-booming-so-why-are-vcs-wary/) "AI sales rep startups are booming. So why are VCs wary?"
* Index has yet to invest in any of these companies, many of which are less than a year old. "When one studies any of [these startups] individually, it's like 'wow, that’s stunning product market fit,'" Shah said. "When all 10 of them have stunning product market fit, it’s hard to answer 'How is that going to play out?'"
* Quote from founder of Docket AI, Arjun Pillai (former Chief Data Officer at ZoomInfo):
	* "Over the last two years, the reply rate on cold emails fell at least 50%," Pillai said. "Now that there are a bunch of companies that claim they can improve this rate, everyone is willing to try their service."

	* The best-known AI SDR startups include Regie.ai, AiSDR, Artisan, and 11x.ai, but ZoomInfo, an incumbent, also released a copilot that competes with these and other virtual sales agent startups.
* Quote from Tomasz Tunguz: *According to Tomasz Tunguz, founder of Theory Ventures, a chief revenue officer from a publicly traded company disclosed to him that while an AI SDR helped generate a substantial volume of leads over a nine-month period, it did not lead to actual sales.*
* [Link Jason Lemkin blog post](https://www.saastr.com/83-percent-of-you-havent-gotten-ai-sdrs-to-work-yet/) to Tomasz Tunguz quote from Sept 2024 AI SDR as the Saastr conference: "83% Percent of You Haven’t Gotten AI SDRs to Work … Yet"
    * At SaaStr Annual, Tomasz Tunguz presented the results of their survey, along with a great story of a public company CRO who had deployed AI SDRs and generated a ton of pipeline … but no closed deals. 
    * As you can see above, only 3% of you have generated real revenue from AI SDRs.  83% of you haven’t gotten anything from AI SDRs. 
    * But 11% are building some pipe at least from AI SDRs.  So that’s something to get better at, and build on.
I would be cautious today.  No one needs to be sending more spam.  But be realistic, take your time, experiment, tune the engine.  And let’s run this survey in another 9-12 months.  And see if the numbers go up.

#### Critical point about differentiated data!
* Gf has 1st party data
* Chris Farmer, partner and CEO at venture firm SignalFire, said he believes that AI applied to sales and marketing is a large opportunity, but without access to differentiated data, AI SDR startups risk being overtaken by incumbents like Salesforce, HubSpot, and ZoomInfo. 
    * the keepers of their customers’ data. So if they offered bots that let their customers tap into their own data, such bots could be more effective.

#### Cautionary tale re: Jasper AI
* Another venture capitalist who looked at this market but hasn’t yet invested said her firm looked at several AI SDR startups and that they all had $1 million in ARR within less than a year. 
* The startups’ impressive growth was attractive, she said, but like Farmer, she was concerned their solutions could eventually be offered as a free feature by established competitors. 
* Jasper, a copywriting startup that was last valued at $1.5 billion but ran into speed bumps and had to lay off 30% of its staff after ChatGPT was introduced, serves as a cautionary tale for some investors. 
* Investors are not surprised by the rapid adoption of AI SDRs; they are just doubting that adoption is sticky.
