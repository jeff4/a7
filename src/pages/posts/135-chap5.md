## Part II / Chapter 5 / Theory of Value

1. It is now about a hundred years since the publication in Leipzig of a book which by the beginning of the nineteenth century had run through over thirty editions; it was circulated and distributed in town and country by the authorities, by preachers and philanthropists of all kinds, and was generally prescribed as a reader for use in the elementary schools. 
1. This book was Rochow’s *Kinderfreund*. 
1. Its purpose was to teach the youthful offspring of the peasants and artisans their vocation in life and their duties to their superiors in society and in the state, and likewise to inspire in them a beneficent contentment with their lot on earth, with black bread and potatoes, serf labour, low wages, paternal thrashings and other delectations of this sort, and all that by means of the system of enlightenment which was then in vogue. 
1. With this aim in view the youth of the towns and of the countryside was admonished how wisely nature had ordained that man must win his livelihood and his pleasures by labour, and how happy therefore the peasant or artisan should feel that it was granted to him to season his meal with bitter labour, instead of, like the rich glutton, suffering the pangs of indigestion or constipation, and having to gulp down the choicest tit-bits with repugnance. 
1. These same platitudes that old Rochow thought good enough for the peasant boys and girls of the electorate of Saxony of his time, are served up to us by Herr Dühring on page 14 and the following pages of his *Cursus* as the 'absolutely fundamental' basis of the most up-to-date political economy.
1. 'Human wants as such have their natural laws, and their expansion is confined within limits which can be transgressed only by unnatural acts and only for a time, until these acts result in nausea, weariness of life, decrepitude, social mutilation and finally salutary annihilation... 
1. 'A game of life consisting purely of pleasures without any further serious aim soon makes one blasé, or, what amounts to the same thing exhausts all capacity to feel. 
1. 'Real labour, in some form or other, is therefore the natural social law of healthy beings... 
1. 'If instincts and wants were not provided with counterbalances they could hardly bring us even infantile existence, let alone a historically intensified development of life. 
1. 'If they could find satisfaction without limit and without effort they would soon exhaust themselves, leaving an empty existence in the form of boring intervals lasting until the wants were felt again... 
1. 'In every respect, therefore, the fact that the satisfaction of the instincts and passions depends on the surmounting of economic obstacles is a salutary basic law of both the external arrangement of nature and the inner constitution of man'
1. ...and so forth and so on.
1. It can be seen that the commonest commonplaces of the worthy Rochow are celebrating their centenary in Herr Dühring, and do so, moreover, as the 'deeper foundation' of the one and only really critical and scientific 'socialitarian system'.
1. With the foundations thus laid, Herr Dühring can proceed to build. 
1. Applying the mathematical method, he first gives us, following the ancient Euclid's example, a series of definitions. 
1. This is all the more convenient because it enables him at once to contrive his definitions in such a way that what is to be proved with their help is already partially contained in them. And so we learn at the outset that
	* *the governing concept in all prior political economy has been wealth and that wealth, as it really has been understood hitherto and as it has developed its sway in world history, is "economic power over men and things"*.

***

1. This is doubly wrong. 
1. In the first place the wealth of the ancient tribal and village communities was in no sense a domination over men. 
1. And secondly, even in societies moving in class antagonisms, wealth, in so far as it includes domination over men, is mainly and almost exclusively a domination over men exercised *by virtue of*, and *through the agency of*, the domination over things. 
1. From the very early period when the capture of slaves and the exploitation of slaves became separate branches of business, the exploiters of slave-labour had to buy the slaves, acquiring control over men only through their prior control of things, of the purchase price of the slave and of his means of subsistence and instruments of labour. 
1. Throughout the Middle Ages large landed property was the prerequisite by means of which the feudal nobility came to have quit-rent peasants and corvée peasants. 
1. And nowadays even a six-year-old child sees that wealth dominates men exclusively by means of the things which it has at its disposal. 
1. But what is it that makes Herr Dühring concoct this false definition of wealth, and why has he to sever the actual connection which existed in all former class societies? 
1. In order to drag wealth from the domain of economics over into that of morals. 

***

1. Domination over things is quite all right, but domination over men is an evil thing; and as Herr Dühring has forbidden himself to explain domination over men by domination over things, he can once again do an audacious trick and explain domination over men offhand by his beloved force. 
1. Wealth, as domination over men, is 'robbery'--and with this we are back again at **a corrupted version of Proudhon's ancient formula: "Property is theft".** And so we have now safely brought wealth under two essential aspects, production and distribution: wealth as domination over things–production wealth, the good side; wealth as domination over men--distribution wealth up to the present day, bad side away with it! 
1. Applied to the conditions of today, this means: The capitalist mode of production is quite good and may remain, but the capitalist mode of distribution is no good and must be abolished. 
1. Such is the nonsense which comes of writing on economics without even having grasped the connection between production and distribution.

***

1. After wealth, value is defined as follows:
	* 'Value is the worth which economic things and services have in commerce.' 
	* This worth corresponds to 'the price or any other equivalent name, for example wages'.
1. In other words, value is the price. Or rather, in order not to do Herr Dühring an injustice and give the absurdity of his definition as far as possible in his own words: *value are the prices*. 
1. For he says on page 19: 'value, and the prices expressing it in money'--
1. --thus himself stating that the same value has very different prices and consequently also just as many different values. 
1. If Hegel had not died long ago, he would hang himself, with all his theologies he could not have thought up this value which has as many different values as it has prices. 
1. It requires once more someone with the positive assurance of Herr Dühring to inaugurate a new and deeper foundation for economics with the declaration that there is no difference between price and value except that one is expressed in money and the other is not. 
1. But all this still does not tell us what value is, and still less by what it is determined. 
1. Herr Dühring has therefore to come across with further explanations.
	* *'Speaking absolutely in general, the basic law of comparison and evaluation, on which value and the prices expressing it in money depend, belongs in the first place to the sphere of pure production, apart from distribution, which introduces only a second element into the concept of value.*
	* *'The greater or lesser obstacles which the variety of natural conditions places in the way of efforts directed toward the procurement of things, and owing to which it necessitates a greater or lesser expenditure of economic energy, determine also...the greater or lesser value',* 
	* *...and this is appraised according to...*
	* *'the resistance offered by nature and circumstances to the procuring of things*
	* *'The extent to which we invest our own energy into them' (things)*
	* *'is the immediate determining cause of the existence of value in general and of a particular magnitude of it'.*
1. In so far as there is a meaning in this, it is: The value of a product of labour is determined by the labour-time necessary for its production; and we knew that long ago, even without Herr Dühring. 
1. Instead of stating the fact simply, he has to twist it into an oracular saying. 
1. It is simply wrong to say that the dimensions in which anyone invests his energies in anything (to keep to the bombastic style) is the immediate determining cause of value and of the magnitude of value. 
1. In the first place, it depends on what thing the energy is put into, and secondly, how the energy is put into it.
1. If someone makes a thing which has no use-value for other people, his whole energy does not produce an atom of value; and if he is stiff-necked enough to produce by hand an object which a machine produces twenty times cheaper, nineteen-twentieths of the energy he put into it produces neither value in general nor any particular magnitude of value.

***

1. Moreover it is an absolute distortion to transform productive labour, which creates positive products, into a merely negative overcoming of a resistance. 
1. In order to come by a shirt we should then have to set about it somewhat as follows: Firstly we overcome the resistance of the cotton-seed to being sown and to growing, then the resistance of the ripe cotton to being picked and packed and transported, then its resistance to being unpacked and carded and spun, further the resistance of the yarn to being woven, then the resistance of the cloth to being bleached and sewn, and finally the resistance of the completed shirt to being put on. 
1. Why all this childish perversion and perversity? 
1. In order, by means of the 'resistance', to pass from the 'production value', the true but hitherto only ideal value, to the 'distribution value', the value, falsified by force, which alone was acknowledged in past history:
	* *'In addition to the resistance offered by nature...there is yet another, a purely social obstacle...An obstructive power steps in between man and culture, and this power is once again man.*
	* *'Man, conceived as alone and isolated, faces nature as a free being...*
	* *'The situation is different as soon as we think of a second man who, sword in hand, holds the approaches to nature and its resources and demands a price, whatever form it may take, for allowing access.*

This second man...so to speak, puts a tax on the other and is thus the reason why the value of the object striven for turns out greater than it might have been but for this political and social obstacle to the procuring or production of the object... 
The particular forms of this artificially enhanced worth of things are extremely manifold. And it naturally has its concomitant counterpart in a corresponding forcing down of the worth of labour {23} ... It is therefore an illusion to attempt to regard value in advance as an equivalent in the proper sense of this term, that is, as something which is of equal worth, or as a relation of exchange arising from the principle that service and counter-service are equal... On the contrary, the criterion of a correct theory of value will be that the most general cause of evaluation conceived in the theory does not coincide with the special form of worth which rests on compulsory distribution. This form varies with the social system, while economic value proper can only be a production value measured in relation to nature and in consequence of this will only change with changes in the obstacles to production of a purely natural and technical kind”
