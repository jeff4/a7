* Medicare spending grew 5.9% to $944.3 billion in 2022, or 21 percent of total NHE.
* Medicaid spending grew 9.6% to $805.7 billion in 2022, or 18 percent of total NHE.

### Remington Report

* The truth is although prior authorizations has been an issue among healthcare providers for many years, little is known about the cost, either to individual practices or the healthcare system as a whole. 
* In 2009, one study estimated that on average, prior authorization requests consumed about **20 hours a week per medical practice**: 
	1. **1 hour** of the doctor’s time, 
	1. **~2 hours** of clerical time, 
	1. **13 hours** of nurses’ time.
* A study by Health Affairs further revealed that when the time is converted to dollars, practices spent an average of *$68,274 per physician per year interacting with health plans*. 
* **This equates to $23 billion and $31 billion annually!** 
* Prior authorization ultimately ends up costing the health care system more than it saves.

### 2019 Report by NIHCR 
* by National Institute For Health Care Reform
* [Link to PDF](https://www.nihcr.org/wp-content/uploads/Altarum-Prior-Authorization-Review-November-2019.pdf)
* Authors: Ani Turner, George Miller, Samantha Clark
* From footnote 5: American Medical Association. 2016 AMA Prior Authorization Physician Survey. 2016. https://www.ama- assn.org/sites/ama-assn.org/files/corp/media-browser/public/government/advocacy/2016-pa-survey- results.pdf. Published 2017. Accessed July 25, 2019.
	* Reference to footnote 5 is on page 6 of PDF: 'Physicians have reported that, overall, **72% of PA requests are approved on initial request and an additional 7% are approved on appeal**. <sup>5</sup> 
* PAs are typically only valid for a specified length of time, after which additional requests must be submitted for continued prescription refills or therapies.
#### Notes on NIHCR funding
* Funding by Altarum Institute Center for Sustainable Health Spending
* The National Institute for Health Care Reform is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, nonpartisan organization established by the International Union, UAW; Chrysler Group LLC; Ford Motor Company; and General Motors to conduct health policy research and analysis to improve the organization, financing and delivery of health care in the United States.
* From 2009 through 2013, the Institute contracted with the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC) to conduct health policy research and policy analyses under the direction of HSC President Paul B. Ginsburg, PhD. Beginning in 2014, NIHCR has funded Altarum Institute’s Center for Sustainable Health Spending (CSHS), the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center (Detroit URC), and the Urban Institute to conduct research and policy analyses with an emphasis on research to improve health in Detroit.

## 3/05/2023

1. **How many patient visits per year?**
	* From [2023 Commonwealth Fund report](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022), about 4 visits per patients per year as of 2022.
	* multiplied by 330m people in the US in 2022, 330m * 4 = *1.32 billion patient visits per year.*
1. **How many prior auth requests?**
	* From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians_in_the_United_States) there are ~1m doctors in the US. Probably about 990,000. That number fits with 3 doctors per 1000 people, 301 doctors per 100,000 people. 330m * 0.3% = 990k doctors in the US.
	* combining 990k doctors * 41 prior auths generated per week per physician (from AKASA report) = 40.6m prior auths generated per week.
	* 40m prior auths requests * 52 weeks = *2 billion prior auth requests per year.*
	* this means that *there about 1.5 prior auth requests per doctor visit*. 
1. **what percentage of prior auth requests get denied?**
	* Unclear. According to [KFF 2021](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/over-35-million-prior-authorization-requests-were-submitted-to-medicare-advantage-plans-in-2021/), about 5% of prior auths are denied, but that only samples from Medicare Part B.
		* If we use the 5% number, that means that 100m denials of prior auth requests per year.
1. **Cost impact**
1. **Care impact**

### 2022 AMA Survey on PA (Prior Authorization) Infographic #1
* [Link to infographic PDF](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-survey.pdf)
* 'For those patients whose treatment requires PA, how often does this process delay access to necessary care?' **94% report delays**.
* ' How often do issues related to the PA process lead to patients abandoning their recommended course of treatment?' **80% lead to some abandonment**.

### 2022 AMA Survey on PA (Prior Authorization) Infographic #2
1. [Link to infographic PDF](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-reform-progress-update.pdf)
1. Increase in number of PA requirements from 2018-2022
	* For prescription medications, 81% of physicians report that the number of PAs has increased in the last 5 years.
	* For medical services, 80% of physicians report that the number of PAs has increased in the last 5 years.
1. 64% and 61% (for prescription medication and medical services, respectively) of physicians report that it is somewhat or extremely difficult to determine whether prescription or med service require PA.
1. Continuity of patient care. **89% of physicians** report that PA interferes with continuity of care.
1. Physicians report **phone** as the most commonly used method for completing PAs. 
	* Moreover, *only 29% of physicians report that their EHR* system offers electronic PA for prescription medications.
	* *Table of usage* Phone (54%,56%); Fax (47%,45%); EMR/PMS (52%,33%); Plan portal (40%,40%); Email or US Mail (24%,26%). 


### New sources on number of prior authorization requests per year
* the below sources are not ideal
	1. This KFF source (aka Kaiser Health News) draws data only from Medicare Advantage in 2021. 
		* [Headline](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/over-35-million-prior-authorization-requests-were-submitted-to-medicare-advantage-plans-in-2021/#:~:text=Just%20over%202%20million%20prior,or%20in%20part%20in%202021): 'Over 35 Million Prior Authorization Requests Were Submitted to Medicare Advantage Plans in 2021' of which 2 million were fully or partially denied.
		* 2m / 35m =  5% of all prior auths have been denied
	1. This [JAMA article from 2021](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2780396) only examines Medicare Part B.
		* 'This cross-sectional study examined medical services paid for by government-administered Medicare Part B, which lacks prior authorization requirements, for approximately **6.5 million beneficiaries**; **2.2 services per beneficiary per year** would have been subject to prior authorization under the coverage rules of a large Medicare Advantage insurer, and these services accounted for 25% of annual Part B spending.'

### AKASA report from May 2023
* [Link](https://akasa.com/blog/prior-authorization-trends/)
* According to AKASA research, submitting and checking the status of a prior authorization request takes *12 minutes and 7 seconds**.
* With **41 prior authorizations per physician per week**, it’s no surprise that 88% of physicians say the burden associated with prior authorizations is “high” or “extremely high.”

### 2022 Crowe Report 
* [Link to PDF](https://www.crowe.com/-/media/crowe/llp/widen-media-files-folder/h/hospital-double-whammy-less-cash-in-more-cash-out-chc2305-001b.pdf)
* Title: 'Hospital double whammy: Less cash in, more cash out Increasingly frugal payors and high inflation add up to a big financial headache for hospitals and health systems'
* From pg 7, denial rate for these providers sampled by Crowe LLP public accounting firm. Increased from 10.2% in early 2021 to 11% by 2022. I don't like this b/c the monthly chart on pg 7 tells a different story. 1.5 - 2.0% per month...how does that add up to 10% per year? It doesn't.

From the AMA report:
Prior authorization’s financial impact
“Prior-authorization denials on inpatient accounts are a key driver behind the dollar value of denials increasing to 2.5% of gross revenue in August 2022 from 1.5% of gross revenue in January 2021,” the report says. “That’s an increase of 67%.”

A couple more numbers from that same source: A study by Health Affairs further revealed that when the time is converted to dollars, practices spent an average of $68,274 per physician per year interacting with health plans. This equates to $23 billion and $31 billion annually! Prior authorization ultimately ends up costing the health care system more than it saves.

A fantastic number to have would be X patient visits per year -> lead to Y prior auth requests -> Of which Z get initially denied......(translated to some $ number in cost impact)
