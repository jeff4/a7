From the AMA report:
Prior authorization’s financial impact
“Prior-authorization denials on inpatient accounts are a key driver behind the dollar value of denials increasing to 2.5% of gross revenue in August 2022 from 1.5% of gross revenue in January 2021,” the report says. “That’s an increase of 67%.”

A couple more numbers from that same source: A study by Health Affairs further revealed that when the time is converted to dollars, practices spent an average of $68,274 per physician per year interacting with health plans. This equates to $23 billion and $31 billion annually! Prior authorization ultimately ends up costing the health care system more than it saves.

***

A fantastic number to have would be X patient visits per year -> lead to Y prior auth requests -> Of which Z get initially denied......(translated to some $ number in cost impact)
