## Part II / Chapter 7 / Capital and Surplus Value, 1 of 2

1. 'To begin with, Herr Marx does not hold the accepted economic view of capital, namely, that it is a means of production already produced; on the contrary, he tries to get up a more special, dialectical-historical idea that toys with metamorphoses of concepts and history. 
1. 'According to him, capital is born of money, it forms a historical phase opening with the sixteenth century, that is, with the first beginnings of a world market, which presumably appeared at that period. 
1. 'It is obvious that the keenness of national-economic analysis is lost in such a conceptual interpretation. 
1. 'In such barren conceptions, which are represented as half historical and half logical, but which in fact are only bastards of historical and logical fantasy, the faculty of discernment perishes, together with all honesty in the use of concepts'--and so blusters for a whole page:
	* *'Marx's definition of the concept of capital can only cause confusion in the strict theory of national economy...frivolities which are palmed off as profound logical truths...the fragility of foundations'* and so forth...

***

1. So according to Marx, we are told, capital was born of money at the beginning of the sixteenth century. 
1. This is like saying that fully three thousand years ago metallic money was born of cattle, because once upon a time cattle, among other things, functioned as money. 
1. Only Herr Dühring is capable of such a crude and inept manner of expressing himself. 
1. In the analysis which Marx makes of the economic forms within which the process of the circulation of commodities takes place, money appears as the final form. 
1. “This final product of the circulation of commodities is the *first form* in which capital *appears*. 
1. As a matter of history, capital, as opposed to landed property, invariably takes the form at first of money; it appears as moneyed wealth, as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer...We can see it daily under our very eyes. 
1. All new capital, to commence with, comes on the stage, that is, on the market, whether of commodities, labour, or money, even in our days, in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be transformed into capital.” Here once again Marx is stating a fact. 
1. Unable to dispute it, Herr Dühring distorts it: Capital, he has Marx say, is born of money! 
1. Marx then investigates the processes by which money is transformed into capital, and finds, first, that the form in which money circulates as capital is the inversion of the form in which it circulates as the general equivalent of commodities. 
1. The simple owner of commodities sells in order to buy; he sells what he does *not* need, and with the money thus procured he buys what he does need. 
1. The incipient capitalist starts by buying what he does not need himself; he buys in order to sell, and to sell at a higher price, in order to get back the value of the money originally thrown into the transaction, augmented by an increment in money; and Marx calls this increment *surplus-value*. 
1. Whence comes this surplus-value? 
1. It cannot come either from the buyer buying the commodities under their value, or from the seller selling them above their value. 
1. For in both cases the gains and the losses of each individual cancel each other, as each individual is in turn buyer and seller. 
1. Nor can it come from cheating, for though cheating can enrich one person at the expense of another, it cannot increase the total sum possessed by both, and therefore cannot augment the sum of the values in circulation. 
1. 'The capitalist class, as a whole, in any country, cannot over-reach themselves.'

***

1. And yet we find that in each country the capitalist class as a whole is continuously enriching itself before our eyes, by selling dearer than it had bought, by appropriating to itself surplus-value. 
1. We are therefore just where we were at the start: whence comes this surplus-value? 
1. This problem must be solved, and it must be solved in a *purely economic way*, excluding all cheating and the intervention of any force–the problem being: how is it possible constantly to sell dearer than one has bought, even on the hypothesis that equal values are always exchanged for equal values? 
1. The solution of this problem was the most epoch-making achievement of Marx’s work. 
1. It spread the clear light of day through economic domains in which socialists no less than bourgeois economists previously groped in utter darkness. 
1. Scientific socialism dates from the discovery of this solution and has been built up around it. 
1. This solution is as follows: The increase in the value of money that is to be converted into capital cannot take place in the *money* itself, nor can it originate in the *purchase*, as here this money does no more than realise the price of the commodity, and this price, inasmuch as we took as our premise an exchange of equivalents, is not different from its value. 
1. For the same reason, the increase in value cannot originate in the *sale* of the commodity. 
1. The change must, therefore, take place in the *commodity* bought; not however in its *value*, as it is bought and sold at its value, but in its *use-value* as such, that is, the change of value must originate in the consumption of the commodity. 
1. 'In order to be able to extract value from the consumption of a commodity, our friend, Moneybags, must be so lucky as to find...in the market, a commodity, whose use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual consumption, therefore, is itself an embodiment of labour, and, consequently, a creation of value. 
1. The possessor of money does find on the market such a special commodity in capacity for labour or labour-power.' 
1. Though, as we saw, labour as such can have no value, this is by no means the case with labour-power. 
1. This acquires a value from the moment that it becomes a commodity, as it is in fact at the present time, and this value is determined, 'as in the case of every other commodity, by the labour-time necessary for the production, and consequently also the reproduction, of this special article'; that is to say, by the labour-time necessary for the production of the means of subsistence which the labourer requires for his maintenance in a fit state to work and for the perpetuation of his race. 
1. Let us assume that these means of subsistence represent six hours of labour-time daily. 
1. Our incipient capitalist, who buys labour-power for carrying on his business, i.e., hires a labourer, consequently pays this labourer the full value of his day's labour-power if he pays him a sum of money which also represents six hours of labour. 
1. And as soon as the labourer has worked six hours in the employment of the incipient capitalist, he has fully reimbursed the latter for his outlay, for the value of the day's labour-power which he had paid. 
1. But so far the money would not have been converted into capital, it would not have produced any surplus-value. 
1. And for this reason the buyer of labour-power has quite a different notion of the nature of the transaction he has carried out. 
1. The fact that only six hours’ labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive for twenty-four hours, does not in any way prevent him from working twelve hours out of the twenty-four. 
1. The value of the labour-power, and the value which that labour-power creates in the labour-process, are two different magnitudes. 
1. The owner of the money has paid the value of a day’s labour-power; his, therefore, is the use of it for a day--a whole day’s labour. 
1. The circumstance that the value which the use of it during one day *creates* is double its own value for a day is a piece of especially good luck for the buyer, but according to the laws of exchange of commodities by no means an injustice to the seller. 
1. On our assumption, therefore, the labourer each day *costs* the owner of money the value of the product of six hours’ labour, but he *hands over* to him each day the value of the product of twelve hours' labour. 
1. The difference in favour of the owner of the money is six hours of unpaid surplus-labour, a surplus-product for which he does not pay and in which six hours’ labour is embodied. 
1. The trick has been performed. 
1. Surplus-value has been produced; money has been converted into capital. 
1. In thus showing how surplus-value arises, and how alone surplus-value can arise under the domination of the laws regulating the exchange of commodities, Marx exposed the mechanism of the existing capitalist mode of production and of the mode of appropriation based on it; he revealed the core around which the whole existing social order has crystallised. 
1. However, this creation of capital requires that one essential prerequisite be fulfilled: 'For the conversion of his money into capital the owner of money must meet in the market with the free labourer, free in the double sense, that as a free man he can dispose of his labour-power as his own commodity, and that on the other hand he has no other commodity for sale, is short of everything necessary for the realisation of his labour-power.' 
1. But this relation between the owners of money or of commodities on the one hand, and those who possess nothing beyond their own labour-power on the other, is not a natural relation, nor is it one that is common to all historical periods: 'It is clearly the result of a past historical development, the product...of the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production.' 
1. And in fact we first encounter this free labourer on a mass scale in history at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century, as a result of the dissolution of the feudal mode of production. 
1. With this, however, and with the bringing into being of world trade and the world market dating from the same epoch, the basis was established on which the mass of the existing movable wealth was necessarily more and more converted into capital, and the capitalist mode of production, aimed at the creation of surplus-value, necessarily became more and more exclusively the prevailing mode. 
1. Up to this point, we have been following the 'barren conceptions' of Marx, these 'bastards of historical and logical fantasy' in which 'the faculty of discernment perishes, together with all honesty in the use of concepts'. 
1. Let us contrast these 'frivolities' with the 'profound logical truths' and the 'definitive and most strictly scientific treatment in the sense of the exact disciplines', such as Herr Dühring offers us. 
1. So Marx 'does not hold the accepted economic view of capital, namely, that it is a means of production already produced'; he says, on the contrary, that a sum of values is converted into capital only when it increases its value, when it forms surplus-value. 
1. And what does Herr Dühring say?
	* *'Capital is a basis of means of economic power for the continuation of production **and for the formation of shares in the fruits of the general labour-power**'.*

***
1. However oracularly and slovenly that too is expressed, this much at least is certain: the basis of means of economic power may continue production to eternity, but according to Herr Dühring’s own words it will not become capital so long as it does not form 'shares in the fruits of the general labour-power'--that is to say, form surplus-value or at least surplus-product. Herr Dühring therefore not only himself commits the sin with which he charges Marx--of not holding the accepted economic view of capital--but besides commits a clumsy plagiarism of Marx, 'badly concealed' by high-sounding phrases. On page 262 this is further developed:
	* *'Capital in the social sense [and Herr Dühring still has to discover a capital in a sense which is not social] is in fact specifically different from the mere means of production; for while the latter have only a technical character and are necessary under all conditions, the former is distinguished by its social power of appropriation and the formation of shares. It is true that social capital is to a great extent nothing but the technical means of production in their social function; but it is precisely this function which...must disappear'.*
