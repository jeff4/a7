## Babbage and the Mechanisation of Mental Labour
### Quotes
1. Charles Babbage (1832): 'We must remember that another and a higher science, itself still more boundless, is also advancing with a giant's stride ... It is the science of calculation -- which becomes continually more necessary at each step of our progress, and which must ultimately govern the whole of the applications of science to the arts of life.'

### Computation as division of labour

1. In early nineteenth-century England, 'computer' was not the name of a machine but of a human -- namely an office clerk, often a woman, who had to make tedious calculations by hand for the government, the Astronomical Society, or the Navy. 
1. At times 'computers' were also working from home, receiving stacks of numbers to calculate and sending back results by mail: this was literally the first historical occurrence of a computing network that took the form of domestic labour and probably involved further family members. 
1. With the aim of streamlining this time-consuming and error- prone process, the polymath Charles Babbage had the idea of replacing the repetitive work of many 'computers' with an automated machine powered by steam. 
1. Henry Colebrooke, presenting Babbage with a gold medal at the Astronomical Society of London in 1823 for the invention of the Difference Engine, declared: 
	* *In other cases, mechanical devices have substituted machines for simpler tools or for bodily labour...*
	* *But the invention to which I am adverting...substitutes mechanical performance for an intellectual process...*
	* *Mr. Babbage's invention puts an engine in place of the [human] computer.*
1. Babbage's Difference Engine, celebrated as the precursor of modern computers, was born out of a business ambition -- to automate the calculations of logarithms and sell error-free logarithmic tables, which were crucial in astronomy and for maintaining British hegemony in maritime trade. 
1. Among other instigators, it was the problem of the longitudinal calculus in open sea that gave a special impetus to mechanised computation. 
1. Small mechanical calculators already existed, but they were not automated and solved only the basic mathematical operations. 
1. Babbage had the idea of connecting a complex logarithmic calculator to the continuous motion provided by steam engines, so as not to have just a calculating device, but a calculating engine that could establish the business of calculation at an industrial scale -- with the fantasies of unbounded performance and unfettered economic growth that the novel word 'engine' carried at the time. 
1. The idea of the automatic computer, in the contemporary sense, emerged out of the project to mechanise the mental labour of clerks rather than the old alchemic dream of building thinking automata -- although the latter narrative would often be used, in the nineteenth century as much as in the century of corporate AI, to masquerade the former business. 
1. Precisely what kind of 'intellectual process', or mental labour, was Babbage aiming to mechanise? 
1. If we are to understand the limitations and potentialities of computation, this is a key clarification, without which even the definition of AI itself can only amplify misunderstandings. 
1. The first kind of mental labour to be mechanised was hand calculation -- a specific skill that persisted until the model of the Turing machine, which was envisioned itself in the form of a human typist (a 'computer') reading and writing figures on a tape, as in a telegraph station. 
1. As chapter 9 will show by following a different genealogy of computation and AI, this was not to be the case with artificial neural networks for pattern recognition, which aimed to automate not hand calculation but the labour of perception and supervision.  
1. Babbage's Difference Engine was a peculiar artefact. 
1. It was not a computer in the contemporary sense, because it did not distinguish software from hardware, instruction from information (fig 2.1). 
1. As it was at the same time both hardware and software, the Difference Engine appears aesthetically intriguing to contemporary eyes: its brass gears and rotating cylinders physically embodied a single algorithm, French mathematician Gaspard de Prony's 'method of differences', which was used to abbreviate the calculation of square numbers and logarithms. 
1. The Difference Engine was also not a computer in the contemporary sense, because it was not a programmable device: the title of an industrial machine featuring an independent input for information belongs to the more modest Jacquard loom. 
1. The Difference Engine prototype was never finalised, while the Jacquard loom was produced in thousands of exemplars and became a driver of the industrial age. 
1. The Jacquard loom set a standard for information storage -- the punched card -- which IBM would maintain with little to no variation until the twentieth century. 
1. Moreover, the first 'digital picture' -- that is, an image described by a numerical file -- happened to be another textile artefact: an 1839 portrait of Jacquard himself that was woven using 24,000 of these punched cards. 
1. Babbage kept a copy of Jacquard's portrait in his studio and adopted the punched card as an input format for another unrealised prototype -- the Analytical Engine -- whose design, unlike its precursor, theoretically separated information from instruction and could evaluate different types of equation.
1. The Difference Engine was not merely the invention of Babbage's lone speculative mind. 
1. As Simon Schaffer has noted, 'places of intelligence' across England assisted Babbage's experiments with mechanical computation and were ultimately the source of his 'machine intelligence'. 
1. Schaffer remarks that Babbage had a more intimate relation with the industrial workshops as a locus of knowledge than with the universities, which, at the time, offered only conservative and notional curricula.  
1. Whereas the hagiographies still depict him as a solitary genius, Babbage was in fact deeply engaged in the industrial milieu of the age and in the debates of the emerging discipline of political economy. 
1. In fact, he authored one of the most influential industrial manuals of the time: On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures (1832).  
1. That the applied division of labour, rather than abstract mathematics, is the 'inventor' of automated computation is also confirmed by the opening of Babbage's book: 'The present volume may be considered as one of the consequences that have resulted from the Calculating-Engine, the construction of which I have been so long superintending.' 
1. This is historical evidence that, as an expression of the division of labour, computation watched over the unfolding of industrial capitalism from its very outset, rather than being a product of its latest developments. 
1. While Babbage tried to convince his reader that the first manual ever published on the management of industrial production was inspired by the project of automated computation, a materialist historian would scrutinise such auto-mythography. 
1. Was it not, rather, the issue of labour organisation and insubordination which prompted the invention of new techniques of discipline and, therefore, urged Babbage to delve into the furnaces of industrial Europe?

### Reckoning with clocks

1. The specific impetus for the mechanisation of mental labour and the invention of automated computation in England came from the need for precise logarithmic tables that, in an age of aggressive colonial expansion, were crucial to keeping orientation along maritime routes. 
1. Logarithmic tables, used to calculate the longitude in open sea, were highly unreliable because of human errors, which caused several shipwrecks and large commercial damages. 
1. The hagiographical anecdotes report that Babbage, mulling over the logarithm books and staring at their numerous errors, exclaimed: 'I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam.' 
1. The first project to accelerate the calculation of logarithmic tables, however, took place not in England but in France, where in 1791 the revolutionary government was engaged in reforming the official measuring system towards the metric system, investing in what Lorraine Daston (to draw an analogy with today's 'big data') calls 'big calculation'. Pursuing an ambitious plan to make the decimal system the standard for angular measurements, the government asked Gaspard de Prony to design the division of the square angle with 100 rather than 90 degrees -- a project which required the logarithmic translation of the old radial fractions into new ones. 
1. Though the plan of angular reform failed, and the millennia-old Sumerian partition of time remains a global standard to this day, the attempt would give momentum to the birth of automated computation.  
1. The Scottish economist Adam Smith wrote a famous account of the division of labour in pin making in The Wealth of Nations. 
1. Smith's picture of the division of labour inspired de Prony, who designed accordingly a sort of collective algorithm for the calculus of logarithms. 
1. De Prony conceived a workflow that was organised as a social pyramid: at the top, he placed a class of mathematicians who would formulate the problem and pass it on to a second class of 'algebraists'; they would then prepare simple operations and data for a third class of human computers who would perform all of the actual calculations on paper sheets, then send them back to their superiors (see fig. 2.2). 
1. Students, often women, and sometimes 'a large number of unemployed hairdressers were used to fill out the numbers on the sheets by adding and subtracting'. De Prony's algorithm applied the aforementioned method of differences, which is based on the fact that the difference between the squares of consecutive numbers remains constant and the interpolation of following squares can be easily reached by simple addition and subtraction in place of complex multiplication.
1. Babbage had the idea of replacing the third class of workers of the calculating pyramid with a machine, as they were repeating tedious tasks of additions and subtractions of a simple difference. 
1. Eventually, the method of differences would provide the algorithm and the name for Babbage's machine: the Difference Engine. 
1. As mentioned above, at the time, mechanical calculators for basic operations already existed and were propelled by hand. 
1. Babbage had the idea of implementing this specific algorithm into a mechanical device and applying a steam engine as a source of motion to turn the calculation of logarithmic tables into an industrial business of scale. 
1. Once the Difference Engine was set in motion, it was supposed to calculate a whole logarithmic table without stopping. 
1. Babbage's project was a fascinating contrivance that sought to give unbounded computational power to cogs and wheels made of brass and wood. 
1. Today, the use of steam as a source of energy for calculation may endure only in the science fiction genre steampunk, but in Babbage's time it was a venture into a world very different than the one we currently inhabit - - one where automated computation would run without electricity.  
1. Babbage's first prototype of the Difference Engine, modestly, was still propelled by hand. 
1. Interestingly, the first device that would take the role of translating de Prony's algorithm for hand calculation into 'matter' was a familiar one: the clock (see fig. 2.2). 
1. Babbage published the general concept of the Difference Engine in the often-forgotten chapter, 'On the Division of Mental Labour', in his 1832 book. 
1. There, he proposed 'what may, perhaps, appear paradoxical to some of our readers -- that the division of labour can be applied with equal success to mental operations, and that it ensures, by its adoption, the same economy of time'. Following de Prony's method of differences, Babbage deconstructed the calculation of logarithmic tables in modular steps and implemented them into a new mechanical algorithm. 
1. The three columns for the table of the method of differences were represented by clocks that Babbage subsequently implemented as rotating cylinders. 
1. In the first working prototype of the Difference Engine (ca. 1833), the step-by-step rotation of cylindrical 'clocks' replaced the movements of a hand, adding digits on a piece of paper. 
1. The artefact of the clock had here the exemplary role of heuristic mediator between the system of numeration and the algorithm of calculation. 
1. If automation is pursued out of the need to save time, its implementation under the clock form itself is emblematic. 
1. It is also revealing that, after being used to measure manual labour productivity in the factory, the clock hand comes to automate hand calculation itself.  
1. These cylindrical clocks were designed to receive a number as an incremental rotation, to add it to a previous number of increments, and to perform a total output under the form of a further incremental rotation. 
1. This movement was, however, imprisoned within a mechanism that could perform, irreversibly, only one large, continuous operation. 
1. Just as it did not distinguish hardware from software, Babbage's clock-cylinders also did not really distinguish numbers from processes, or memory from operations. 
1. These two functions were to be separated in the design of the Analytical Engine (and later in modern computers as the division between memory and the Central Processing Unit). 
1. Another limitation that Babbage's mechanical algorithm confronted was the decimal system itself and the problem of automating the carryover of the tens place, which afflicted mechanical calculation since the time of Pascal. It must be remembered that the binary system was implemented (thanks to Leibniz, Boole, Turing, Shannon, and von Neumann, among others) because it technically simplifies addition and subtraction. 
1. An electric switch can turn on and off, with these two states representing all the necessary units of numeration (see chapter 6). 
1. The Difference Engine's wheels, on the other hand, struggled to contain ten numerals, and Babbage tried to resolve the problem of the remainder by a sophisticated yet clumsy carriage return. 
1. As Matthew Jones has illustrated, for Babbage as for many philosopher- inventors of the modern age, the enterprise of mechanical calculation was not to be distinguished from that of natural philosophy, which aimed at 'reckoning with matter', for the precise reason that reckoning was considered a lower mental activity, something that the 'mechanical' classes (or their machine equivalent) had to perform for the upper classes. 
1. Indeed, most modern natural philosophers (Hobbes aside) maintained that the mind could not be reduced to mechanism. In this political climate, mental labour could therefore be automated because it was a task of the working class, and not one to be regarded as 'thinking' proper.

### Principles of labour analysis

1. Although the Difference Engine easily evokes fascination for historians of Victorian science and technology, Babbage should be remembered less for the machine itself than for the principles of the division of labour that inspired its design. 
1. Historians of science such as Daston and Schaffer have contributed to questioning the Difference Engine's status as the solo violin of early automated computation and instead made visible, on the stage of the industrial age, a less seductive yet more logical protagonist: the division of labour and its social hierarchy. 
1. Schaffer has highlighted that Babbage's 'machine intelligence' proceeded from the 'mindful hands' of workers, craftsmen, and machinists who were building experimental contrivances, as seen above, in 'places of intelligence' such as workshops and factories rather than royal academies. 
1. As Jones details, Babbage publicly pursued Francis Bacon's 'hope for the discovery of a philosophical theory of invention'. Yet the secret of his calculating engine was not the imitation of God's foresight (as Babbage argued) so much as the everyday business of these workshops and factories, made of continuous failures and conflicts with workers, including the insubordination of Babbage's own team. 
1. In order to better understand the design of Babbage's machines and their quality of 'machine intelligence', it is therefore necessary to explicate his two principles of labour analysis: (1) the labour theory of the machine, which states that a new machine comes to imitate and replace a previous As the founder of modern economics, Adam Smith was the first to have sketched a labour theory of the machine in The Wealth of Nations (1776) by recognising that new machines are 'invented' by imitating the organisation of tasks in the workplace: 'The invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.' Whereas the independent tool emerges out of the repetition of a simple manual activity, the machine emerges out of assemblages of these tools. 
1. Given his greater technical experience, Babbage formulated this idea better in his On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures:
	* *Perhaps the most important principle on which the economy of a manufacturer depends, is the division of labour amongst the persons who perform the work...*
	* *The division of labour suggests the contrivance of tools and machinery to execute its processes...*
	* *When each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool, the union of all these tools, actuated by one moving power, constitutes a machine.*
1. The labour theory of the machine is based on a postulate at once technical and economic, according to which a machine emerges only after a coordination of tools has been tested and proved to be successful for production and cost reduction. 
1. If Smith and Babbage are right, and a machine emerges as the experimentation and implementation of a collective division of labour, a political issue comes straightaway to the fore: Who is actually the inventor of the machine? 
1. Who can claim credit for its invention? 
1. Workers, factory masters, engineers, or the orchestration of all these actors? 
1. Who owns the right over such a collective division of labour? 
1. These were actual and highly debated issues in the so-called 'Machinery Question' of the nineteenth century (see chapter 3).  
1. Babbage's further contribution was to frame the labour theory of the machine -- namely, that a machine imitates and replaces a previous division of labour -- in terms of economic planning. 
1. In fact, the division of labour itself emerged not just to better organise labour in modular tasks but to precisely measure (to compute, one is tempted to say) the cost of each task. 
1. The so-called Babbage principle is canonically formulated in this passage:
	* *The master manufacturer, by dividing the work to be executed into different processes, each requiring different degrees of skill and force, can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process;*
	* *whereas, if the whole work were executed by one workman, that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult, and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious, of the operations into which the art is divided.*
1. The Babbage principle states that the organisation of a production process into small tasks (the division of labour) allows for the calculation and precise purchase of the quantity of labour that is necessary for each task (the division of value). 
1. The division of labour establishes a privileged perspective for the surveillance of labour, but also helps to modulate the extraction of surplus labour from each worker according to need. 
1. In more analytical terms, the Babbage principle posits that the abstract diagram of the division of labour helps to organise production while at the same time offering an instrument for measuring the value of labour. 
1. In this respect, the division of labour provides not only the design of machinery but also of the business plan.
1. A fundamental theory of automated computation came from Babbage's application of his principles of labour calculation to the division of mental labour. Notably, he already saw the factory as a sort of knowledge economy from which to extract exact 'quantity of skill and knowledge which is required' from each worker:
	* *The effect of the division of labour, both in mechanical and in mental processes, is, that it enables us to purchase and apply to each process precisely that quantity of skill and knowledge which is required for it:*
	* *we avoid employing any part of the time of a man who can get eight or ten shillings a day by his skill in tempering needles, in turning a wheel, which can be done for sixpence a day;*
	* *and we equally avoid the loss arising from the employment of an accomplished mathematician in performing the lowest processes of arithmetic.*
1. Combining both Babbage's principles, one could say that computation emerged as both the automation of the division of mental labour and the calculus of the costs of such labour. 
1. One could postulate that, under the logic of computation, the automation of labour and the calculus of the cost of labour even become the same thing. 
1. After all, to compute means to measure the costs of labour in terms of time, space, energy, resources, and capital. This often neglects, from capital's perspective, the 'human cost' of such labour. As the historian of science Norton Wise has remarked, the division of labour
	* *is actually one of the hierarchy of labour, rather than merely division...*
	* *It separates skill from brute force in order that the manufacturer does not have to pay for them simultaneously...*
	* *But the single principle applies to the entire hierarchy, to machines as to human labourers and to mental as to physical labour, requiring that the numbers and kinds of all sources be allocated so as to minimize cost of production.*
	* *It is a principle of the interior organization of a factory ... which Babbage sought to generalize to the entire political economy.*
