* See also the AmSpa (American Med Spa Association). [website](https://americanmedspa.org). Team, timeline, history, pricing are all located on their [about page](https://americanmedspa.org/why-amspa).
* Looks like MedSpas.com and AmSpa are different organizations. MS.com is about patient education and is a discovery/directory to find a local medspa. Meanwhile, AmSpa has taken on some aspects of a professional org but is a for-profit org started by a healthcare lawyer to focus on the different laws etc. available around the country.
