# Section 2: Background
* Breakdown into: sensing/perception, brain (LLMs for now), action/muscles
## 2.1 Origin of AI Agent
### 2.1.1 Agent in Philosophy
### 2.1.2 Philosophy and Intentional Stance: 
* Debate between researchers: Is assuming Intention useful or not useful for AI/Robotics research?
* 'we can define AI by saying that it is a subfield of computer science that aims to design and build computer-based agents that exhibit aspects of intelligent behavior. So we can treat "agent" as a central concept in AI.' 

### 2.1.3 Introduction of agents into AI
* 'Instead, researchers employ other attributes to help describe an agent, such as properties of autonomy, reactivity, pro-activeness and social ability. 
	* There are also researchers who held that intelligence is "in the eye of the beholder"; it is not an innate, isolated property. 
	* In essence, an AI agent is not equivalent to a philosophical agent; rather, it is a concretization of the philosophical concept of an agent in the context of AI. 
	* In this paper, we treat AI agents as artificial entities that are capable of perceiving their surroundings using sensors, making decisions, and then taking actions in response using actuators.

#### Abstract
* This paper explores existing works of multi-agent systems and identify challenges that remain inadequately addressed. By leveraging the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents within a multi-agent system, these systems can tackle complex tasks through collaboration. We discuss optimizing task allocation, fostering robust reasoning through iterative debates, managing complex and layered context information, and enhancing memory management to support the intricate interactions within multi-agent systems. We also explore the potential application of multi-agent systems in blockchain systems to shed light on their future development and application in real-world distributed systems.
